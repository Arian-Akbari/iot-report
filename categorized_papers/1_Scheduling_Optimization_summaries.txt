The paper addresses the challenging problem of job shop scheduling, specifically focusing on minimizing the makespan, which is the total time required to complete a set of jobs on machines with prescribed sequences. Job shop scheduling is a well-known NP-complete problem, making exact solutions infeasible for larger instances. The authors propose the Shifting Bottleneck Procedure, which sequences machines iteratively, where in each iteration a bottleneck machine is identified and sequenced optimally followed by local reoptimization of the sequences of previously sequenced machines. The method relies on solving simpler one-machine scheduling problems to determine the order of machines based on their impact on the overall makespan. A key innovation of this approach is its ability to continuously reoptimize schedules, which often leads to improved outcomes compared to traditional priority-based heuristics.

In computational experiments, the authors demonstrated the effectiveness of their method, notably achieving optimal schedules for notoriously complex problems involving ten jobs and ten machines within minutes – a task that other algorithms have struggled with for much longer durations without success. The methodology uses a directed acyclic graph representation for scheduling and implements an O(n) algorithm for finding the longest path, which is crucial for determining critical paths in the scheduling process. With the proposed relaxation and reevaluation strategy, the Shifting Bottleneck Procedure serves as a viable alternative to conventional scheduling practices, showcasing its capability to yield superior scheduling efficiencies and providing avenues for further research into optimization techniques for job shop scheduling in industrial applications.

The presented research focuses on addressing the Non-preemptive Open-Shop Scheduling Problem (OSSP) using a simulated annealing algorithm aimed at minimizing the makespan, defined as the total time taken from the start of the first job to the completion of the last one. The OSSP involves scheduling a set of jobs across multiple machines, where each job consists of tasks that need to be allocated efficiently to minimize downtime and resource conflicts. Given that the OSSP is NP-hard, this study leverages simulated annealing—a probabilistic technique to approximate the global optimum of a given function—due to its effectiveness in exploring large solution spaces. The proposed algorithm starts with a generation of an initial feasible schedule and iteratively adjusts it through transformations while maintaining feasibility until a stopping criterion is met. The cooling schedule, governing the temperature parameter in simulated annealing, is fine-tuned for optimal performance. Benchmarks from Taillard’s problem instances were utilized to evaluate the effectiveness of the algorithm. Results indicate that the approach successfully identifies optimal solutions across various instances, demonstrating robustness and speed; execution times did not exceed five minutes for even the most complex instances evaluated. In total, the methodology integrates systematic neighborhood transformations (swap and shift-rotate operations) thereby ensuring a balance between exploration and exploitation in the solution space. The practical implications suggest that this algorithm could be employed in real-world manufacturing environments for improved scheduling efficiency, with avenues for further refinement through hybridization with other optimization strategies or domain-specific adaptations.

The paper addresses the limitations of traditional flexible job shop scheduling (FJSP) models that do not allow operations of a job to be processed across different factories. This assumption is increasingly unrealistic in modern manufacturing environments characterized by economic globalization and complexity in job processes. The authors propose the distributed flexible job shop scheduling problem with transfers (DFJSPT), where job operations can be transferred among multiple factories, which introduces new challenges in scheduling. To tackle this problem, they develop an efficient memetic algorithm (EMA) that combines evolutionary algorithms with local search strategies to optimize scheduling across distributed manufacturing sites. The EMA features unique chromosome representations, initialization methods, and a range of crossover and mutation operators to enhance the solution process. The authors test the EMA's performance against 40 benchmark instances specifically created for DFJSPT. Furthermore, they employ the Taguchi method to determine optimal parameter settings for the EMA, ensuring robust performance in minimizing not only the makespan but also energy consumption and workload across factories. The experimental results indicate that the EMA outperforms traditional algorithms such as NSGA-II, NNIA, and NSGA-III in around 90% of instances, confirming the approach's effectiveness in tackling DFJSPT. In conclusion, the proposed method not only contributes to theoretical advancements in scheduling but also provides practical implications for improving efficiency in modern distributed manufacturing environments. Consequently, the study emphasizes the importance of accounting for operation transfers in job scheduling and sets the stage for further research into multi-objective optimization in flexible manufacturing systems.

This paper presents an innovative approach to solving the dynamic flexible job shop scheduling (DFJSS) problem using genetic programming hyper-heuristics (GPHH) with a focus on enhancing parent selection through a diverse partner selection (DPS) method. Traditional methods have relied on fitness-based selection, which can limit diversity and lead to suboptimal solutions due to selecting similar parents. The proposed GPDPS method introduces a multi-case fitness evaluation that not only assesses individual fitness but also characterizes the diverse behavior of scheduling heuristics across multiple scenarios. This allows for a more robust selection mechanism that prioritizes complementary pairs of parents for crossover, encouraging genetic diversity and improving performance. The GPDPS algorithm has been tested against the traditional GPHH on eight distinct DFJSS scenarios, characterized by different optimization objectives and utilization levels. Experimental results demonstrate that GPDPS surpasses GPHH on maximum objectives like flowtime and tardiness while maintaining competitive results on mean objectives. The findings highlight the importance of parent diversity in enhancing offspring quality and convergence speed. Future work aims to further refine the DPS method to variably adapt to mean objectives while continuing to optimize maximum objectives. Key technical contributions include the development of a novel fitness evaluation strategy, an effective pair selection method that promotes complementarity among selected parents, and a thorough experimental framework evaluating numerous scenarios relevant to real-world scheduling environments.

The paper addresses the job shop scheduling problem (JSSP), a critical challenge in manufacturing that demands optimal product scheduling under various constraints. Traditional methods have relied on mathematical programming, simulation, and meta-heuristics, each with varying degrees of effectiveness and efficiency. The authors propose a new methodology that combines data-driven insights and mathematical optimization to enhance scheduling outcomes. Instead of merely utilizing a predicted schedule without ensuring constraint satisfaction, the proposed approach guarantees that the initial solution used in optimization is viable according to 0-1 mixed integer programming (0-1 MIP) constraints. This improvement addresses a notable limitation in previous works where constraints were often violated, necessitating post-hoc modifications that could degrade solution quality. Utilizing a two-layer neural network for predicting operational sequences reduces learning time significantly, nearly halving the computational effort compared to prior methods. This dual-focus on constraint adherence and enhanced learning efficiency results in a marked improvement in solution times, significantly outperforming previous methodologies. The underlying data for this analysis stems from a benchmark JSSP dataset generated with a uniform distribution of processing times, simulating real-world variability in manufacturing contexts. Evaluation metrics included solution times across multiple trials demonstrating the robustness and reliability of the new method. Future work will explore the impact of various operational variables, including different machine assignments, job counts, and processing time variances, and further refine predictions to eliminate circular sequences, enhancing overall scheduling accuracy and efficiency in manufacturing environments.

The flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSP) is notorious for its computational complexity and real-world applicability in industrial manufacturing, where operations can be executed on multiple machines with specific sequence-dependent setup times and limited resources. This paper presents a novel approach using a policy network based on reinforcement learning (RL) to address the challenges of the extended FJSP comprehensively. The primary objective is to minimize the total completion time, known as makespan. The methodology involves developing a neural network that utilizes six carefully selected state features to inform decision-making at each scheduling point, where it selects both the operation to perform and the machine on which it will be executed. Three dispatching rules are formulated within the network, allowing the policy to adapt dynamically based on real-time scheduling conditions, which improves its performance over traditional single-rule methods. Performance metrics from experiments with ten benchmark instances demonstrate that the proposed policy network consistently outperforms both standard heuristic approaches and other intelligent algorithms, indicating its efficacy for complex, large-scale industrial scheduling applications. The results not only underscore the practical significance of RL methods in FJSP but also suggest implications for future research in adaptive scheduling and optimization techniques. Furthermore, the robustness of the model is evidenced by the statistical analysis conducted on the results, suggesting that it can effectively learn to select optimal rules depending on the state of the system, thus paving the way for more intelligent manufacturing systems capable of handling intricate scheduling dilemmas.

The paper addresses the machine-scheduling problem, characterized as the task of processing a set of items on multiple machines, where the order of processing may be partially defined. The primary goal is to minimize the total elapsed time for completion. The author proposes an integer linear programming (ILP) model, which can accommodate diverse scheduling scenarios. Among its significant contributions is the demonstration that a single linear framework can adapt to various situations within machine scheduling. This modeling approach simplifies the challenges involved by establishing a finite algorithm intended for optimal solution search, thus promising computational advancements in integer linear programming. Key insights reveal that despite the model's computational complexity—which renders it impractical for large problems at present—the potential exists for future refinements in algorithm efficiency. Furthermore, the model suggests employing secondary constraints strategically, allowing for a trial solution method that introduces constraints as needed to eliminate infeasibilities.

The inherent complexity arises from the extensive number of constraints, however, many are typically inoperative for practical problem sizes, suggesting that the core of the solution process can be streamlined through strategic application of constraints. The paper outlines the model's capacity to handle m-stage processes exhaustively, detailing the need for precise definitions of time intervals and dependencies among task sequences. Even with its limitations, the ILP framework shows promise in enhancing the solution to classical scheduling variants, particularly in constrained environments such as when only a few machines are involved.

This paper focuses on the robust job-shop scheduling problem (JSP) characterized by uncertain processing times represented through discrete scenarios. The authors identify that traditional single-objective optimization methods, which minimize the worst-case makespan, are overly conservative without taking optimality into account. Therefore, this research proposes a two-objective optimization framework where one objective minimizes the worst-case makespan while the other minimizes the mean makespan across scenarios. The authors introduce two novel problem-specific neighborhood structures that enhance traditional tabu search operations. The first neighborhood structure enhances solutions for the worst-case scenario, while the second caters to an overall average performance across scenarios. The integration of these structures into hybrid algorithms combining NSGA-II and tabu search boasts improved performance over existing scheduling algorithms.

This paper addresses the challenge of the flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSP), a well-known NP-hard problem in intelligent manufacturing systems that requires efficient real-time responses and optimization strategies. Existing solutions based on reinforcement learning have shown potential but also have limitations related to efficiency and adaptability. Hence, the authors introduce a novel approach termed reinforcement learning with the generative adversarial network (RLGAN) within a parallel learning framework. They establish a simulation-based artificial workshop system (AWS) designed to generate extensive sample plans, providing a robust training dataset for the RLGAN algorithm. The RLGAN integrates features from both reinforcement learning and generative adversarial networks, effectively enabling the training of a scheduling model capable of producing near-optimal scheduling solutions.

The authors perform a case study where they implement their proposed method, QTRAN-GAN, and compare its performance against the purely reinforcement learning approach, QTRAN. Experimental results illustrate that QTRAN-GAN consistently generates superior scheduling plans, demonstrating enhanced performance by achieving lower makespan metrics. The methodology is structured into a closed-loop process of data processing and action learning, where expert input data is augmented through generative techniques to yield large datasets used for training the model. The learning model's architecture consists of a generator that synthesizes plans and a discriminator that evaluates these against expert plans, thereby iteratively optimizing the generator's output based on the discriminator's feedback.

The study validates the effectiveness of the QTRAN-GAN algorithm through extensive computational experiments, where the RLGAN's design incorporates sophisticated elements such as random event simulations representing machine breakdowns within the workshop. Notably, the approach strives to minimize makespan as a critical production objective, assigning a reward function inversely correlated with makespan duration. Outcomes reveal a significant performance advantage of QTRAN-GAN over the baseline QTRAN, with average performance improvements recorded across training and evaluation phases.

This paper introduces Beam-ACO, a novel hybrid approach that combines the methodologies of ant colony optimization (ACO) and beam search (BS) to efficiently tackle open shop scheduling (OSS) problems. OSS is known to be NP-hard, presenting significant challenges for conventional solution techniques. The essence of Beam-ACO lies in its systematic construction of solutions using probabilistic decision-making, influenced by pheromone trails established during prior searches—similar to ACO—but implemented through the structured exploration method of beam search, which focuses on a set of the most promising partial solutions at each stage of the search process. 

A detailed methodology was presented in the paper, which outlines how each artificial ant performs a probabilistic beam search, generating multiple candidate solutions simultaneously while adhering to constraints specific to OSS. The results indicate that Beam-ACO outperforms existing algorithms, including the best known methods for OSS, in numerous benchmark tests, demonstrating both superior solution quality and efficiency. The algorithm's structure allows it to adaptively adjust to the dynamics of the search landscape, utilizing lower bounds to guide the search effectively. Notably, Beam-ACO is shown to outperform Standard-ACO significantly, achieving optimal solutions for all tested Taillard benchmark instances and improving upon the best-known solutions across various OSS benchmark instances from literature. 

Overall, the hybridization of ACO with BS not only enhances the solution quality for OSS but also opens avenues for applying Beam-ACO to other combinatorial optimization problems where tree search techniques thrive. Future research will expand the applicability of Beam-ACO, potentially incorporating more adaptive mechanisms and experimenting with different problem domains beyond OSS.

This paper addresses the distributed flexible job shop scheduling problem with crane transportation (DFJSPC), a critical issue brimming with complexities in modern manufacturing environments caused by global industrial shifts. The DFJSPC is modeled using a novel integer programming framework with dual objectives: minimizing the makespan—the total time taken for job completion—and the total energy consumption (TEC) during both machine processing and crane operations. The decision-making process is guided by realistic considerations of various constraints arising from crane transportation. Central to the solution is a hybrid algorithm that smartly combines the Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) and Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS).

It incorporates a self-adaptive mechanism for its probability matrices which ensures robust convergence rates while minimizing premature convergence that can skew results. Furthermore, it deploys a sophisticated probability variable to manage computational activities, ensuring efficient resource utilization.

In parallel, the VNS component augments the exploitation ability of the EDA by implementing five specialized neighborhood structures for performance enhancement with both global and local strategies, refining solutions iteratively within localized neighborhoods. Experimental results from a series of simulations demonstrate that the EDA-VNS hybrid outperforms existing algorithms in terms of efficiency and solution quality, validating the significance of the integrated strategies. The results indicate substantial improvements in achieving reduced makespan and lowered energy consumption, making this approach highly relevant for industries committed to energy efficiency and productivity.

The practical applications of this research lie in various manufacturing fields, including automotive, textiles, and assembly lines, where distributed systems are vital.

This paper investigates insertion techniques for job shop scheduling problems where setup times are required due to job processing order. Traditional scheduling typically relies on priority rules, but recent experiments suggest that insertion algorithms—where operations are systematically inserted into partial schedules—yield significantly better results. The authors specifically address job shop scheduling with sequence-independent setup times and examine both item and batch availability. In their approach, each job is assessed based on a defined technological route and a specific release date, with jobs categorized into distinct groups. They introduce multiple objectives for minimizing completion times, including regular and nonregular criteria such as makespan and weighted earliness/tardiness penalties.

The methodology incorporates a beam search technique to refine the scheduling process further, enhancing the insertion algorithm by allowing multiple operations to be inserted in parallel. A comparative study was conducted using a large dataset of test problems, wherein the proposed insertion methods were rigorously analyzed against established priority rules. The results indicated a substantial performance improvement of the insertion algorithms, particularly for complex scheduling scenarios characterized by limited job availability.

Key findings demonstrate that the effectiveness of insertion strategies varies notably with the chosen objective function and the structure of the job shop problem. In scenarios where setup times play a critical role, the results indicate a compelling case for adopting insertion tactics over conventional priority rules. The authors conclude that while this area presents significant challenges, especially in optimizing for nonregular criteria, further research and development of iterative improvement algorithms based on local search could yield even more efficient solutions in job shop scheduling contexts. The findings contribute meaningfully to the operational research discourse, offering a robust framework for tackling complex job scheduling problems amidst varying conditions of job and machine availability.

This paper addresses the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP), which allows operations to be processed on multiple machines and is recognized as a strongly NP-hard problem. Traditional approaches like Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) face challenges with computational efficiency and the tendency to converge to local optima. This paper proposes an Improved Ant Colony Optimization (IACO) algorithm to tackle these issues by introducing a selection mechanism for machine assignment, a uniform distribution for ants' initialization, and enhanced pheromone update strategies. The methodology focuses on optimizing the makespan, which is the total time required to complete the scheduling of all jobs.

The proposed IACO algorithm consists of several key improvements: it employs different probabilities for machine selection, ensuring that operations will be processed by the most appropriate machines; it distributes ants' initial positions uniformly to increase the diversity of paths taken and prevent premature convergence; it adjusts pheromone values to facilitate exploration when the search gets stuck in local optimal solutions; and it enforces boundaries on the pheromone levels to maintain solution quality.

The algorithm was tested against an actual production instance and various benchmark instances, demonstrating its effectiveness through comparative analysis. Results indicate that IACO not only provides superior solutions in terms of makespan but does so within a reasonable computational timeframe, outperforming basic ACO and other hybrid algorithms in efficiency and solution quality. This work significantly contributes to the ability to optimize scheduling in real-world manufacturing contexts, paving the way for future explorations into multi-objective scenarios and dynamic environments due to the nature of real-world production systems, where unexpected events frequently occur.

This paper addresses the inefficiencies arising from a decentralized two-machine job-shop scheduling system where individual managers aim to minimize their local flow-time objectives instead of a global flow-time objective. The research employs game theoretic frameworks to analyze the decentralization cost (DC), which measures the performance degradation from the centralized optimal solution to the best decentralized Nash equilibrium.

The SS method incorporates two specific algorithms: GA-based Simultaneous Scheduling (GA-SS) and VNS-based Simultaneous Scheduling (VNS-SS), which were tested against static and dynamic scheduling scenarios using experimental setups involving datasets like the Brandimarte dataset for static FJSP and customized instances for DFJSP. Results indicated that SS significantly reduces wait time and improves computational efficiency. For static problems, VNS-SS demonstrated better outcomes against both GA-SS and traditional EA methods, suggesting that leveraging the processing time while improve scheduling in real-time yields high-performance metrics such as makespan. In DFJSP scenarios, GA-SS outperformed VNS-SS, showcasing its robustness in dynamic settings where job releases are stochastic. Overall, SS proved to be a highly effective scheduling approach, bridging gaps in traditional scheduling methods and enhancing practical applications in industrial settings where efficiency and responsiveness to job dynamics are paramount. Future work may involve extending the SS framework to incorporate more complex job shop environments and refining the EAs for enhanced convergence speed without sacrificing solution quality.

The study introduces the Teaching-Learning Based Optimization (TLBO) algorithm, demonstrating its application to both flow shop scheduling (FSSP) and job shop scheduling (JSSP), marking the first instance of its testing on combinatorial optimization problems. Scheduling problems are recognized as NP-hard, making them complex yet vital for production management. TLBO mimics educational dynamics, comprising two main phases - the teacher phase, where a teacher influences learner outcomes, and the learner phase, where peer interaction enhances learning. The implementation utilizes a random key approach for job permutation and employs the G&T algorithm for active schedule construction. Extensive empirical studies were conducted using benchmark sets (e.g., Taillard's problems) to evaluate TLBO's efficiency through performance metrics such as makespan, average relative percentage deviation (ARPD), and comparisons with existing heuristics (e.g., genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization). Results illustrate that TLBO is competitive, often producing superior or comparable solutions against well-known heuristic algorithms. Particularly, it exhibits substantial potential in optimizing scheduling tasks, highlighting it as a promising tool for future exploration in combinatorial optimization research. Further studies could refine TLBO or extend to other problem domains to enhance algorithm robustness and applicability in practical scenarios.

The paper addresses the Dynamic Job Shop Scheduling (DJSS) problem, which involves scheduling jobs in environments characterized by random job arrivals and machine breakdowns—conditions often overlooked by traditional static scheduling methods. A Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) algorithm is employed, enhanced by an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) that updates VNS parameters during rescheduling. The multi-objective performance measure focuses on minimizing makespan and tardiness, critical factors in operational efficiency. Through a series of simulations involving a job shop setup with 10 machines, the effectiveness of the proposed method was compared against several standard dispatching rules, including Shortest Processing Time (SPT), First In First Out (FIFO), Last In First Out (LIFO), and Earliest Due Date (EDD).

The job-shop scheduling problem (JSSP) is acknowledged as one of the most complex combinatorial optimization challenges in scheduling and logistics. This problem involves allocating a set of jobs to a limited number of machines while ensuring that each job is processed according to specific constraints. Despite extensive research over the past three decades, no polynomial-time algorithm has successfully solved JSSP optimally. The paper presents a detailed tutorial survey focusing on hybrid genetic algorithms (GAs) that integrate classical heuristics with genetic mechanisms to enhance performance in solving JSSP. 

The survey emphasizes evolving effective representations suitable for genetic algorithms, highlighting various encoding strategies that have been developed to produce feasible solutions. Effective representations are crucial given the constraints present in scheduling, as traditional binary encoding can yield infeasible schedules. The paper categorizes hybrid methods into three approaches: adapting problems for GAs, adapting GAs for specific problem characteristics, and a combination of both. The use of local search techniques alongside genetic algorithm frameworks is discussed, which improves solution quality through fine-tuning existing genetic solutions.

Key findings indicate that integrating local heuristic methods into genetic algorithms, particularly ones designed to handle the precedence constraints inherent in job scheduling, can significantly improve schedule quality. For example, the 'Giffler and Thompson' algorithm is highlighted as a potent local search approach integrated within the GA framework to optimize the scheduling process further. 

The paper outlines various hybridization methods such as adapted genetic operators, heuristic-featured genetic operators, and combinations with local search techniques, thus providing a robust understanding of the current state of hybrid approaches in GJSPs and suggesting that successful strategies often require a complete understanding of both genetic algorithms and the specific problem constraints they address.

In conclusion, hybrid genetic algorithms demonstrate significant potential for addressing the JSSP, offering promising results through innovative solution representation and the integration of heuristic methods. The insights gained from this survey not only highlight the effectiveness of these hybrid strategies but also lay the groundwork for future advancements in solving other complex combinatorial optimization problems through algorithmic enhancements.

This paper tackles the Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP) using a novel hybrid algorithm comprising Brain Storming Optimization (BSO) and Late Acceptance Hill Climbing (LAHC). The FJSSP is recognized for its complexity and is categorized as NP-hard due to both job routing and sequencing sub-problems.

Traditional job shop scheduling constraints have been modified to accommodate flexible operations where the same job can be processed multiple times on a set of machines. The proposed method is innovative, leveraging both Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Grouping Genetic Algorithm (GGA) to develop a two-module scheduling algorithm.

The experimental design tailored for this study involves simulating scenarios with varying numbers of orders to analyze the performance discrepancy between the proposed method (GGA for MSM and GA for OSM) and conventional methods used in practice, known as Weapon Production Scheduling (WPS). Results illustrate that the combined approach significantly reduces tardiness and idle times compared to WPS in both simple and complex problem scenarios. The findings are substantial, suggesting that integrating GGA and GA into scheduling operations can yield marked improvements in manufacturing efficiency and adaptability.

The results demonstrate that WOA-LFDE outperforms the competition across various metrics, confirming its efficacy for JSSP.

In detail, the WOA encompasses two main phases: exploration, characterized by global searching behaviors, and exploitation, focusing on local refinements. The integration of Lévy flights allows the algorithm to sample potential solutions more effectively across the search space. Meanwhile, DE contributes its strength in local search, thereby maintaining a robust population of solutions and preventing stagnation.

The job-shop scheduling problem (JSP) is critical for efficient production planning, especially in environments where manufacturing orders change frequently. Traditional approaches to minimizing makespan typically rely on exact methods that can be computationally intensive or heuristic methods that lack optimality assurance. The introduction of Ising machines, which leverage quantum computing principles, provides an exciting avenue for optimization. However, using Ising machines directly for makespan minimization in JSP has inherent challenges due to the need for binary variable formulations. The present work introduces a novel decomposition approach that splits the makespan minimization problem into two parts, a master-problem focusing on estimating the minimum makespan and a sub-problem for the constraint satisfaction aspect. This technique enables the iterative resolution of the problems, progressively refining the makespan estimation until an acceptable sub-optimal solution is reached or the specified termination criteria are met. The study demonstrates the practical effectiveness of this method through experiments that confirm its speed, achieving results that are up to 5.2 times faster than traditional commercial solvers. The method's reliance on the quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) model allows for efficient handling of complex problem parameters using Ising technology. Key findings reveal that this approach not only fulfills the requirements of minimizing makespan but also adapits swiftly to real-time scheduling needs, thereby paving the way for future research and applications in optimization tasks involving adaptive manufacturing scenarios.

It identifies a significant gap in the existing literature, in which little attention has been paid to establishing mathematical models for the fuzzy version of the job shop problem, thus limiting the effectiveness of comparative assessments of new algorithms. To resolve this, the authors propose two mathematical models: one based on mixed integer linear programming (MILP) and another utilizing constraint programming (CP). These models are formulated to accommodate the uncertainties of processing times represented as fuzzy numbers, specifically triangular fuzzy numbers. The study employs state-of-the-art commercial solvers to analyze the scalability and performance of both models against previously established benchmark instances, totaling 149 instances that vary in size from 36 to 2000 tasks.

The research also highlights the significance of considering both exact algorithms (through MILP and CP) and heuristic approaches (using metaheuristics), suggesting that while the exact methods excel at smaller and medium-sized instances, the complexity of larger instances often necessitates the adoption of metaheuristics. The results reveal that the CP model generally outperforms the MILP model, providing more reliable bounds and achieving optimal solutions for many instances within acceptable time limits.

Importantly, the work updates the best-known lower and upper bounds on the optimal makespan for all instances analyzed, with 83 instances certified as optimal for the first time, improving upon the existing literature significantly.

As the workforce ages, their physical capabilities may diminish even as their experience levels increase, prompting a need for a more tailored scheduling approach. The authors acknowledge that while digitalization and automation can help adapt production environments for older workers, the integration of their needs into operational scheduling remains problematic. The research focuses on incorporating fatigue—a byproduct of physical exertion—into the scheduling processes typical of Dual-Resource Constrained (DRC) job shops. Various models are proposed to embed Rest Allowance (RA) into conventional scheduling, providing a means to systematically include considerations for worker fatigue related to ageing. Key innovations include an easy-to-use heuristic method that delivers results suitable for practical industrial applications, balancing work assignments according to both physical characteristics and experience. The authors validate their approach through case studies, offering managerial insights into improving production performance whilst safeguarding worker well-being. The findings underscore the importance of reevaluating traditional scheduling practices to accommodate the unique profile of an ageing workforce, leading to potential improvements in both productivity and worker satisfaction. This research not only contributes to the literature on job-shop scheduling but also emphasizes the necessity of integrating human factors into production decision-making, thereby paving the way for more inclusive and adaptive operations management strategies for diverse workforce demographics.

This paper addresses the problem of scheduling n independent jobs on m parallel machines to minimize total weighted flowtime, a critical aspect of operations research and production management. Previous methods, notably those developed by Elmaghraby and Park, and later by Barnes and Brennan, used a branch and bound approach that, although effective, was computationally expensive due to its reliance on extensive enumeration and permutations of job orders.

The authors introduce a novel branching scheme that significantly reduces computation by focusing directly on job allocation to machines—termed Scheme 2—in contrast to the previous Scheme 1, which relied on generating eligible partial permutations. This new method allows for a combined approach to job scheduling while maintaining optimality, thereby yielding a reduced number of schedules to evaluate computationally. The authors also propose an improved lower bound that is straightforward to calculate, thus enhancing the overall efficacy of the algorithm.

The practical implications of this new approach are underscored by extensive computational experiments, which illustrate that the proposed scheme can solve larger instances of the scheduling problem within feasible time limits, something that proved challenging for the previous methods under similar constraints. The results presented indicate that the computational time required using the new method is several times less than that required by the existing methods, demonstrating its superiority in performance. This advancement in scheduling algorithms not only provides a more efficient means of solving these problems but also opens avenues for further research in optimizing more complex scheduling scenarios. This paper thus contributes significantly to the field of production scheduling, both in theoretical developments and in practical applications.

The study addresses the complex problem of distributed flexible job shop scheduling (DFJSP) with crane transportations, which has gained interest as global manufacturing evolves. Recognizing that traditional scheduling methods often overlook constraints such as crane transportation and energy usage, the authors propose a novel hybrid algorithm that integrates an Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) with a Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) approach. This hybridization is necessary due to the NP-hard nature of the DFJSPC, particularly under crane operation constraints. The problem is first modeled using integer programming, focusing on optimizing both makespan and total energy consumption (TEC) across machine processes. Notably, the EDA is designed to identify superior individuals from a population based on fitness, employing self-adaptive parameter settings in probability matrices to enhance convergence stability and solution quality. The VNS complements EDA's explorative strengths with refined local searches through multiple problem-specific neighborhood structures. Five such structures enhance the algorithm's ability to exploit promising areas of the solution space. Testing against other competitive algorithms showcases the hybrid EDA-VNS method's efficiency, offering significant advancements in performance for the DFJSPC. Key contributions include the development of an efficient identification rule for crane conditions, a self-adaptive probability mechanism for EDA activity control, and an exploration-exploitation balance that is vital for overcoming traditional algorithm shortcomings. Future implications could see expanded applications in various manufacturing industries, emphasizing the need for sustainable and energy-efficient production practices.

The paper presents DeepMAG, an innovative model for flexible job shop scheduling (FJSS) that combines deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to effectively manage complex scheduling tasks in real-world manufacturing environments. Traditional scheduling methods often face severe limitations due to the lack of integration between DRL and MARL, causing inefficiencies in dealing with the large state and action spaces associated with FJSS.

The paper addresses the challenge of flexible job-shop scheduling problems (FJSP), which require simultaneous consideration of operation assignments to machines and their sequence. Traditional methods often struggle with the complex combinatorial nature of these problems,especially when considering sequence-dependent setup times, machine release dates, and other factors. To overcome these limitations, the authors propose a novel two-stage genetic algorithm (2SGA) characterized by an innovative solution encoding method in its first stage, which focuses purely on operational sequencing.

The second stage mirrors a typical genetic algorithm approach, enabling comprehensive exploration of the solution space to include options potentially excluded by the greedy strategy of the first stage. The algorithm was rigorously tested against numerous benchmark datasets and various large-scale FJSP scenarios, demonstrating significant performance enhancements over traditional competitive algorithms. Notably, while high-performance parallel implementations offered theoretical advantages, the sequential implementation of the 2SGA was able to outperform them, particularly in larger problem sizes. This finding underscores the importance of efficient initial population generation and the effectiveness of staged greedy selection processes in accelerating convergence toward optimal solutions. Overall, this work contributes to the progression of scheduling methodologies within manufacturing environments, suggesting pathways toward practical implementations in complex industrial contexts.

The authors propose a novel two-stage algorithm that leverages convolutional neural networks (CNN) to improve scheduling performance. The first stage involves training the CNN model using data generated by an improved imperialist competition algorithm (ICA) designed to address the scheduling sequence and resource allocation efficiency.

The paper addresses the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP), a well-known NP-Hard optimization issue involving the allocation of jobs on machines with the objective to minimize the makespan, or the total time to complete all jobs. Traditionally, scheduling techniques used uniform Priority Dispatching Rules (PDR), which resulted in suboptimal performance. In response, the authors propose a new approach using multiple PDRs tailored to individual machines on the shop floor. The methodology includes the development of a simulation model whereby different dispatching rules are tested across scenarios with an extensive database for training an inference model that can predict the optimal rule based on specific scheduling conditions. This simulation-based strategy allows for dynamic adaptation of rules, aiming to reduce makespan significantly compared to traditional methods. Experimental results show that utilizing varied dispatching rules for each machine can improve scheduling outcomes, achieving a reduction in makespan in 38% of the tested scenarios and demonstrating a range of improvement of 1% to 8% over the best single rule from previous studies. Performance metrics illustrate the effectiveness of this approach over conventional methods, validating the benefit of a more holistic consideration of dispatching rules tailored to individual machine characteristics. Future work aims to refine this model by integrating it with data mining techniques to enable real-time decision-making, thus further enhancing adaptive responses in dynamic scheduling environments. Furthermore, a goal is set to establish an intelligent decision support system that eliminates the need for repeated simulations by leveraging historical data to guide dispatching rule selection efficiently.

In this paper, Dauzere-Peres and Lasserre introduce a modified shifting bottleneck (MSB) procedure aimed at optimizing job-shop scheduling, which is critical in various manufacturing and production environments. The original shifting bottleneck procedure, developed by Adams et al., has shown superior performance in scheduling jobs across multiple machines while minimizing makespan (the total time required to complete a set of tasks). However, this technique harbors certain limitations, particularly regarding its handling of job dependencies and variability in performance tied to the number of optimization cycles employed.

The authors tackle these issues by extending Carlier's algorithm, which is integral to the original SB method. By modifying this algorithm, the authors allow for precedence relations between jobs, ensuring that the sequencing of tasks respects these dependencies. They show that their modifications help guarantee a monotonic decrease in makespan during re-optimization cycles, thereby addressing the erratic behavior observed in the traditional SB method.

A series of computational tests were conducted using well-known problem instances (the 10 jobs, 10 machines and 5 jobs, 20 machines problems) to evaluate the effectiveness of the MSB procedure against both the standard SB method and other heuristics. Results indicated that the MSB procedure consistently yielded better or comparable performance across various scenarios, demonstrating robustness against the number of optimization cycles utilized. For instance, the authors report a makespan improvement from 1015 in the standard SB to 950 using their MSB algorithm for the 10x10 problem, corroborated by achieving results closer to optimal solutions in other instances.

The implications of this research extend to practical applications in scheduling where dependencies are prevalent, making the MSB procedure a valuable addition to operational research methodologies used in job-shop scheduling. The authors suggest avenues for future work that may include further enhancement of the algorithm's efficiency and application to other scheduling contexts.

The computational experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms traditional weighted-sum approaches and several other evolutionary algorithms concerning solution diversity and Pareto-optimality. The study validates that the localized search strategies amplify the foundational strengths of MODJA, particularly in diverse scheduling environments. The findings have practical implications for industrial scheduling operations, suggesting that the MODJA could serve as a robust tool for production managers seeking efficient scheduling solutions. The research outlines future avenues, including further refinements to the algorithm and potential adaptations for real-time scheduling adjustments, thus promising greater applicability in dynamic manufacturing settings.
