      "abstract": "The flexible job shop scheduling problems (FJSP) has been studied for many years, and many different mathematical models and solution approaches have been developed. With the proposal and implementation of Industry 4.0, more focus has been on the integrated optimization of the FJSP to enhance its practicality. However, few reviews on the integrated optimization of the FJSP have been reported. To grasp the current development trend of the integrated FJSP (I-FJSP), this paper presents a comprehensive literature review of the I-FJSP and its extensions. In this context, 140 related articles were collected and analyzed. First, the mathematical model of the FJSP and the overview framework are presented. Subsequently, five different integration models of the FJSP are explained and corresponding qualitative analyses are conducted. Finally, research challenges and directions that can be attempted are demonstrated.

      "abstract": "Scheduling is an important tool for a manufacturing system, where it can have a major impact on the productivity of a production process. In order to find an optimal solution to scheduling problems it gives rise to complex combinatorial optimization problems. Unfortunately, most of them fall into the class of NP-hard combinatorial problems. In this paper, we focus on the design of multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) to solve a variety of scheduling problems. Firstly, we introduce fitness assignment mechanism and performance measures for solving multiple objective optimization problems, and introduce evolutionary representations and hybrid evolutionary operations especially for the scheduling problems. Then we apply these EAs to the different types of scheduling problems, included job shop scheduling problem (JSP), flexible JSP, Automatic Guided Vehicle (AGV) dispatching in flexible manufacturing system (FMS), and integrated process planning and scheduling (IPPS). Through a variety of numerical experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of these Hybrid EAs (HEAs) in the widely applications of manufacturing scheduling problems. This paper also summarizes a classification of scheduling problems, and illustrates the design way of EAs for the different types of scheduling problems. It is useful to guide how to design an effective EA for the practical manufacturing scheduling problems.",

      "abstract": "An extended version of the flexible job shop problem is tackled in this work. The investigated extension of the classical flexible job shop problem allows the precedences between the operations to be given by an arbitrary directed acyclic graph instead of a linear order. The problem consists of designating the operations to the machines and sequencing them in compliance with the supplied precedences. The goal in the present work is the minimization of the makespan. In order to produce reasonable outcomes in acceptable time, a hybrid imperialist competitive algorithm and tabu search is proposed to solve the problem. Numerical experiments assess the efficiency of the proposed method and compare it with well-known scheduling algorithms.",

      "title": "The Shifting Bottleneck Procedure for Job Shop Scheduling",
      "abstract": "We describe an approximation method for solving the minimum makespan problem of job shop scheduling. It sequences the machines one by one, successively, taking each time the machine identified as a bottleneck among the machines not yet sequenced. Every time after a new machine is sequenced, all previously established sequences are locally reoptimized. Both the bottleneck identification and the local reoptimization procedures are based on repeatedly solving certain one-machine scheduling problems. Besides this straight version of the Shifting Bottleneck Procedure, we have also implemented a version that applies the procedure to the nodes of a partial search tree. Computational testing shows that our approach yields consistently better results than other procedures discussed in the literature. A high point of our computational testing occurred when the enumerative version of the Shifting Bottleneck Procedure found in a little over five minutes an optimal schedule to a notorious ten machines/ten jobs problem on which many algorithms have been run for hours without finding an optimal solution.",
      "method": "We sequence the machines one at a time, consecutively. In order to do this, for each machine not yet sequenced we solve to optimality a one-machine scheduling problem that is a relaxation of the original problem, and use the outcome both to rank the machines and to sequence the machine with highest rank. Every time a new machine has been sequenced, we reoptimize the sequence of each critical machine that is susceptible to improvement by again solving a one-machine problem.",
      "objectives": "To provide an effective approximation method for solving the minimum makespan problem in job shop scheduling, improving upon existing scheduling methods.",
      "summary": "The paper addresses the challenging problem of job shop scheduling, specifically focusing on minimizing the makespan, which is the total time required to complete a set of jobs on machines with prescribed sequences. Job shop scheduling is a well-known NP-complete problem, making exact solutions infeasible for larger instances. The authors propose the Shifting Bottleneck Procedure, which sequences machines iteratively, where in each iteration a bottleneck machine is identified and sequenced optimally followed by local reoptimization of the sequences of previously sequenced machines. The method relies on solving simpler one-machine scheduling problems to determine the order of machines based on their impact on the overall makespan. A key innovation of this approach is its ability to continuously reoptimize schedules, which often leads to improved outcomes compared to traditional priority-based heuristics.\n\nIn computational experiments, the authors demonstrated the effectiveness of their method, notably achieving optimal schedules for notoriously complex problems involving ten jobs and ten machines within minutes – a task that other algorithms have struggled with for much longer durations without success. The methodology uses a directed acyclic graph representation for scheduling and implements an O(n) algorithm for finding the longest path, which is crucial for determining critical paths in the scheduling process. With the proposed relaxation and reevaluation strategy, the Shifting Bottleneck Procedure serves as a viable alternative to conventional scheduling practices, showcasing its capability to yield superior scheduling efficiencies and providing avenues for further research into optimization techniques for job shop scheduling in industrial applications.",

The problem is characterized as NP-complete, and traditional methods of scheduling do not adequately address real-time uncertainties. The authors introduce an Inserting Algorithm (IA) that aims to integrate maintenance tasks into a pre-scheduled framework using heuristic algorithms. Specifically, the study conducts a comparative analysis of three heuristic optimization methods: Genetic Algorithm (GA), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), and Artificial Bee Colony (ABC). The research findings reveal that GA outperforms the other methods in generating optimal schedules while maintaining efficient execution speed, particularly in dynamic scenarios. The proposed IA, while yielding inferior solutions compared to the traditional Simultaneous Scheduling Algorithm (SSA), is noted for its superior speed, allowing for easier integration with existing Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. Empirical results were validated against benchmarks from Neale and Cameron (1979), demonstrating the effectiveness of the new algorithm and highlighting areas for future research, including enhancements to IA and better heuristic methods for scheduling with maintenance activities.

      "abstract": "Today, customer centricity becomes the key success factor for manufacturing companies in gaining sustainable competitive advantage. In this regard, they need advanced production planning and control (PPC) techniques to be more customer focused. This study aims to integrate customer relationship management (CRM) and PPC approaches in order to use manufacturing resources of job shops more effectively in satisfying customers. To this aim, a simulated annealing based simulation optimization approach is proposed. To confirm the viability of the proposed approach, it is applied to a realistic job shop system. In order to accelerate the flow of production, product type based lot splitting is applied. In the scheduling phase, dynamic scheduling is implemented by machine-based dispatching rules. Multiple customer segments with different importance weights, and their expectations and penalties on order completion rate on due date, tardiness and earliness are considered. The aim of the proposed approach is to make near-optimal policy decisions regarding the machine-based dispatching rules and number of equal sublots for the products. In this regard, four well-known dispatching rules and five modified versions of these rules which are proposed in this study are employed. Computational experiments are performed by using different dominance relationships between the customer segments, inter-arrival times and level of due date allowance factor. Results of the experiments reveal that integration of CRM and PPC approaches in job shop systems provides more effective use of resources in satisfying customers, and that the proposed approach can easily be implemented in practice.",

The authors propose a novel algorithm, Knowledge-Based Ant Colony Optimization (KBACO), which synergizes Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) with a knowledge model to enhance the scheduling process. The knowledge model accumulates heuristic information from previous optimization iterations to inform decision-making during the search for optimal schedules.

Through a series of simulations, the study demonstrates that the 2PH-ACO algorithm significantly outperforms standard ACO and other baseline methods concerning the total cost of earliness and tardiness. The experimental results show that 2PH-ACO provides a remarkable average improvement of 67.25% in effectiveness when solving small-scale problems, proving its robustness even in high-dimensional scheduling tasks. In large-scale problems (up to 100 jobs), 2PH-ACO continues to deliver superior results, confirming its applicability for practical use in industry settings. The findings suggest that utilizing the 2PH-ACO can lead to better resource allocation, increased customer satisfaction through improved delivery timelines, and reduced operational costs, making it a valuable tool in the field of production economics.

      "abstract": "The previous studies on the flexible job shop scheduling problems (FJSP) with machine flexibility and worker flexibility normally assume that each machine is operated by one worker at any time. However, it is not accurate in many cases because many workers may be required for machines in processing complex operations. Hence, this paper studies a universal version, i.e., FJSP with worker cooperation flexibility (FJSPWC), which defines that each machine can be used only if their required workers are prepared. A mixed-integer linear programming model tuned by CPLEX is established for the problem aiming to collaboratively minimize the makespan, maximum workload of machines and maximum workload of workers. To solve the problem efficiently, a Pareto-based two-stage evolutionary algorithm (PTEA) is proposed. In the PTEA, a well-tailored initialization operator and the NSGA-II structure are designed for global exploration in the first stage, and a competitive objective-based local search operator is developed to improve its local search ability and accelerate the convergence in the second stage. Extensive experiments based on fifty-eight newly formulated benchmarks are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the well-designed initialization operator and two-stage architecture. Comprehensive experiments are performed to evaluate the proposed PTEA, and the results reveal that the PTEA is superior to four comparison algorithms concerning the distribution, convergence, and overall performance.",

The combining of several optimization criteria induces additional complexity and new problems. Particle swarm optimization is an evolutionary computation technique mimicking the behavior of flying birds and their means of information exchange. It combines local search (by self experience) and global search (by neighboring experience), possessing high search efficiency. Simulated annealing (SA) as a local search algorithm employs certain probability to avoid becoming trapped in a local optimum and has been proved to be effective for a variety of situations, including scheduling and sequencing.

In this paper, we model JSSP as a Markov decision process (MDP) and design a new state representation using the state features of bidirectional scheduling, which can not only enable the agent to capture more effective state information, improve its decision-making ability, but also effectively avoid the phenomenon of multiple optimal action selections in candidate action set.

The OSSP involves scheduling a set of jobs across multiple machines, where each job consists of tasks that need to be allocated efficiently to minimize downtime and resource conflicts. Given that the OSSP is NP-hard, this study leverages simulated annealing—a probabilistic technique to approximate the global optimum of a given function—due to its effectiveness in exploring large solution spaces. The proposed algorithm starts with a generation of an initial feasible schedule and iteratively adjusts it through transformations while maintaining feasibility until a stopping criterion is met.

      "abstract": "A flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSP) is an extension of the classical job shop problem (JSP) where operations are allowed to be processed on any among a set of available machines at a facility. For such problems, it is not always possible to find optimal solution in a reasonable time. Hence, a large variety of heuristic procedures such as dispatching rules, local search, and meta-heuristic procedures are used to solve such problems and generate approximate solutions close to the optimum with considerably less computational time. PSO is an effective algorithm which gives quality solutions in a reasonable computational time and requires less number of parameters to be tuned in comparison to other evolutionary meta-heuristics. However, PSO has an inherent drawback of getting trapped at local optimum due to large reduction in velocity values as iteration proceeds and poses difficulty in reaching at best solution. This drawback can be effectively addressed using quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) due to its advanced global search ability. Mutation, a commonly used operator in genetic algorithm, has been introduced in QPSO so that premature convergence can be avoided. Logistic mapping is used to generate chaotic numbers in this paper. The performance of schedules is evaluated in terms of total completion time or makespan (Cmax). The results are compared with different well-known algorithms used for the purpose from open literature. The results indicate that the proposed QPSO algorithm is quite effective in reducing makespan because small value of relative deviation is observed.",

Here, a novel artificial Physarum polycephalum colony algorithm is proposed to help us address this problem. First, the flexible job shop scheduling problem with transportation constraints is modeled as a state transition diagram and a multi-objective function, where there are ten states in total for state transition, and the multi-objective function considers the makespan, average processing waiting time, and average transportation waiting time. Second, a novel artificial Physarum polycephalum colony algorithm is designed herein with two main operations: expansion and contraction. In the expansion operation, each mycelium can cross with any other mycelia and generate more offspring mycelia, of which each includes multiple pieces of parental information, so the population expands to more than twice its original size. In the contraction operation, a fast grouping section algorithm is designed to randomly group all mycelia according to the original population size, where each group selects the best fitness one to survive, but the other mycelia are absorbed to disappear, so the population size recovers to the original size. After multiple iterations, the proposed algorithm can find the optimal solution to the flexible job shop scheduling problem. Third, a series of computational experiments are conducted on several benchmark instances, and a selection of mainstream algorithms is employed for comparison.

The classical firefly algorithm was modified to accommodate discrete optimization, allowing it to efficiently explore feasible job permutations. The DFA utilizes a specific position value (SPV) rule to convert continuous solutions into permutations suitable for scheduling tasks. The algorithm iteratively updates solutions by comparing light intensities corresponding to the objective values, with adjustments guided by the attractiveness of fireflies. To validate the DFA's efficacy, computational experiments were performed on both real-world and randomly generated test instances. Results demonstrate that the DFA significantly outperforms traditional metaheuristics such as genetic algorithms (GA), parallel genetic algorithms (PGA), ant colony optimization (ACO), and simulated annealing (SA), achieving improved metrics for both makespan and mean flow time across tests. Furthermore, the study suggests various future applications of DFA in addressing more complex aspects of hybrid flowshop scheduling such as varying machine types and due date constraints, thus highlighting its flexibility and potential for broader application in operational scheduling problems. Overall, this research contributes to the field of operations research by proposing a robust algorithm specifically designed to address the intricate dynamics of hybrid flowshop scheduling challenges, backed by substantial empirical evidence of its performance superiority over existing approaches.",

      "abstract": "The traditional distributed flexible job shop scheduling problem (DFJSP) assumes that operations of a job cannot be transferred between different factories. However, in real-world production settings, the operations of a job may need to be processed in different factories owing to requirements of economic globalization or complexity of the job. Hence, in this paper, we propose a distributed flexible job shop scheduling problem with transfers (DFJSPT), in which operations of a job can be processed in different factories. An efficient memetic algorithm (EMA) is proposed to solve the DFJSPT with the objectives of minimizing the makespan, maximum workload, and total energy consumption of factories. In the proposed EMA, a well-designed chromosome presentation and initialization methods are presented to obtain a high-quality initial population. Several crossover and mutation operators and three effective neighborhood structures are designed to expand the search space and accelerate the convergence speed of the solution. Forty benchmark instances of the DFJSPT are constructed to evaluate the EMA and facilitate further studies. The Taguchi method of design of experiments is used to obtain the best combination of key EMA parameters. Extensive computational experiments are carried out to compare the EMA with three well-known algorithms from the literature. The computational results show that the EMA can obtain better solutions for approximately 90% of the tested benchmark instances compared to the three well-known algorithms, thereby demonstrating the DFJSPT’s competitive performance and efficiency.",

This assumption is increasingly unrealistic in modern manufacturing environments characterized by economic globalization and complexity in job processes. The authors propose the distributed flexible job shop scheduling problem with transfers (DFJSPT), where job operations can be transferred among multiple factories, which introduces new challenges in scheduling. To tackle this problem, they develop an efficient memetic algorithm (EMA) that combines evolutionary algorithms with local search strategies to optimize scheduling across distributed manufacturing sites. The EMA features unique chromosome representations, initialization methods, and a range of crossover and mutation operators to enhance the solution process. The authors test the EMA's performance against 40 benchmark instances specifically created for DFJSPT. Furthermore, they employ the Taguchi method to determine optimal parameter settings for the EMA, ensuring robust performance in minimizing not only the makespan but also energy consumption and workload across factories. The experimental results indicate that the EMA outperforms traditional algorithms such as NSGA-II, NNIA, and NSGA-III in around 90% of instances, confirming the approach's effectiveness in tackling DFJSPT.

      "abstract": "Dynamic flexible job shop scheduling (DFJSS) aims to make decisions for machine assignment and operation sequencing simultaneously to get an effective schedule under dynamic environments. Genetic programming hyper-heuristic (GPHH) has been successfully applied to evolve scheduling heuristics for the DFJSS problem. Parent selection plays an important role in GPHH for generating high-quality offspring. Traditional GPHHs select parents for crossover purely based on fitness (e.g., tournament selection). This might be too greedy to get good offspring and the selected parents might have similar structures/behaviours. In this paper, a GPHH method with a new diverse partner selection (DPS) scheme is proposed, namely GPDPS, for DFJSS. Specifically, we first define a new multi-case fitness to characterise the behaviour of each scheduling heuristic for DFJSS. Then, the newly proposed DPS method selects a pair of complementary high-quality parents for crossover to generate offspring. The experimental results show that GPDPS significantly outperforms the GPHH method on most of the DFJSS scenarios, in terms of both test performance and convergence speed.",
      "method": "The proposed GPDPS method takes a population initialized by the ramped-half-and-half method. At each generation, individuals are evaluated by a newly developed multi-case fitness evaluation which calculates standard and case-fitness.

The breeding process includes traditional tournament selection for mutation and reproduction and the new DPS operator for crossover based on the normalized case-fitness. The crossover and mutation rates are dynamically adjusted based on the selection process. These steps repeat until a stopping criterion is met, returning the best individual found.",

Traditional methods have relied on fitness-based selection, which can limit diversity and lead to suboptimal solutions due to selecting similar parents. The proposed GPDPS method introduces a multi-case fitness evaluation that not only assesses individual fitness but also characterizes the diverse behavior of scheduling heuristics across multiple scenarios. This allows for a more robust selection mechanism that prioritizes complementary pairs of parents for crossover, encouraging genetic diversity and improving performance. The GPDPS algorithm has been tested against the traditional GPHH on eight distinct DFJSS scenarios, characterized by different optimization objectives and utilization levels. Experimental results demonstrate that GPDPS surpasses GPHH on maximum objectives like flowtime and tardiness while maintaining competitive results on mean objectives. The findings highlight the importance of parent diversity in enhancing offspring quality and convergence speed. Future work aims to further refine the DPS method to variably adapt to mean objectives while continuing to optimize maximum objectives. Key technical contributions include the development of a novel fitness evaluation strategy, an effective pair selection method that promotes complementarity among selected parents, and a thorough experimental framework evaluating numerous scenarios relevant to real-world scheduling environments.",

In this concept, it is an important point to predict a solution which satisfy constraints of the 0-1 MIP. This paper provides an improved method based on this concept where the prediction is carried out so that the constraints are always satisfied. Numerical experiments showed that solution time of the proposed method is shorter than that of the previous method, which does not assure the constraints are satisfied, and learning time reduces about half. In addition, it turned out that there is a reason of the shorter solution time other than that the predicted solution always satisfies the constraints.

Traditional methods have relied on mathematical programming, simulation, and meta-heuristics, each with varying degrees of effectiveness and efficiency.

While effective, WOA is susceptible to limitations such as premature convergence and difficulties in escaping local optima. This paper introduces an enhanced version of WOA (WOA-LFDE), combining it with Lévy flight—a stochastic method that promotes exploratory behavior through heavy-tailed distributions—and Differential Evolution (DE), known for its robust local optimization capabilities.

It systematically integrates these methods, conducting trials on 88 established JSSP benchmark instances. The evaluation metrics indicated significant performance improvements over existing algorithms, revealing that WOA-LFDE consistently outperforms counterparts in both speed and solution quality.

In this article, a policy network is designed to solve the extended FJSP, with the goal of minimizing the total completion time (makespan). Three dispatching rules are proposed to simultaneously select an operation and assign it on a feasible machine at each scheduling point. To describe the manufacturing status at a scheduling stage, six state features are extracted as the input of the network. After the calculation of the network, the distribution of choosing each dispatching rule is obtained. After all of the operations are completed, the policy network is trained using policy gradient, a well-known reinforcement learning (RL) method.

      "abstract": "Ant colony optimization (ACO) is a metaheuristic approach to tackle hard combinatorial optimization problems. The basic component of ACO is a probabilistic solution construction mechanism. Due to its constructive nature, ACO can be regarded as a tree search method. Based on this observation, we hybridize the solution construction mechanism of ACO with beam search, which is a well-known tree search method. We call this approach Beam-ACO. The usefulness of Beam-ACO is demonstrated by its application to open shop scheduling (OSS). We experimentally show that Beam-ACO is a state-of-the-art method for OSS by comparing the obtained results to the best available methods on a wide range of benchmark instances.",
      "method": "The proposed method, Beam-ACO, combines ant colony optimization (ACO) with beam search (BS) techniques for solving the open shop scheduling problem. It uses a probabilistic beam search approach where each artificial ant constructs solutions in parallel by extending partial solutions based on pheromone values and conditionally selected operations according to a defined heuristic. This hybridization relies on the strengths of both algorithms, allowing for both exploratory and exploitative search strategies in a guided manner.",
      "objectives": "The primary objective of this research is to develop a hybrid algorithm, Beam-ACO, that integrates ant colony optimization and beam search for the open shop scheduling problem.

      "summary": "This paper introduces Beam-ACO, a novel hybrid approach that combines the methodologies of ant colony optimization (ACO) and beam search (BS) to efficiently tackle open shop scheduling (OSS) problems. OSS is known to be NP-hard, presenting significant challenges for conventional solution techniques. The essence of Beam-ACO lies in its systematic construction of solutions using probabilistic decision-making, influenced by pheromone trails established during prior searches—similar to ACO—but implemented through the structured exploration method of beam search, which focuses on a set of the most promising partial solutions at each stage of the search process. \n\nA detailed methodology was presented in the paper, which outlines how each artificial ant performs a probabilistic beam search, generating multiple candidate solutions simultaneously while adhering to constraints specific to OSS. The results indicate that Beam-ACO outperforms existing algorithms, including the best known methods for OSS, in numerous benchmark tests, demonstrating both superior solution quality and efficiency. The algorithm's structure allows it to adaptively adjust to the dynamics of the search landscape, utilizing lower bounds to guide the search effectively. Notably, Beam-ACO is shown to outperform Standard-ACO significantly, achieving optimal solutions for all tested Taillard benchmark instances and improving upon the best-known solutions across various OSS benchmark instances from literature. \n\nOverall, the hybridization of ACO with BS not only enhances the solution quality for OSS but also opens avenues for applying Beam-ACO to other combinatorial optimization problems where tree search techniques thrive. Future research will expand the applicability of Beam-ACO, potentially incorporating more adaptive mechanisms and experimenting with different problem domains beyond OSS.",

      "abstract": "Distributed flexible job shop scheduling has attracted research interest due to the development of global manufacturing. However, constraints including crane transportation and energy consumption should be considered with the realistic requirements. To address this issue, first, we modeled the problem by utilizing an integer programming method, wherein the makespan and energy consumptions during the machine process and crane transportation are optimized simultaneously. Afterward, a hybrid algorithm consisting of estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) and variable neighborhood search (VNS) was proposed to solve the problem, where an identification rule of four crane conditions was designed to make fitness calculation feasible. In EDA component, the parameters in probability matrices are set to be self-adaptive for stable convergence to obtain better output. Moreover, a probability mechanism was applied to control the activity of the EDA component. In VNS component, five problem-specific neighborhood structures including global and local strategies are employed to enhance exploitation ability.

      "summary": "This paper addresses the distributed flexible job shop scheduling problem with crane transportation (DFJSPC), a critical issue brimming with complexities in modern manufacturing environments caused by global industrial shifts. The DFJSPC is modeled using a novel integer programming framework with dual objectives: minimizing the makespan—the total time taken for job completion—and the total energy consumption (TEC) during both machine processing and crane operations. The decision-making process is guided by realistic considerations of various constraints arising from crane transportation. Central to the solution is a hybrid algorithm that smartly combines the Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) and Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS). \n\nThe EDA operates by generating new solutions based on the fitness of existing solutions, effectively sampling the solution space to evolve the population towards better optimality. It incorporates a self-adaptive mechanism for its probability matrices which ensures robust convergence rates while minimizing premature convergence that can skew results. Furthermore, it deploys a sophisticated probability variable to manage computational activities, ensuring efficient resource utilization.\n\nIn parallel, the VNS component augments the exploitation ability of the EDA by implementing five specialized neighborhood structures for performance enhancement with both global and local strategies, refining solutions iteratively within localized neighborhoods. Experimental results from a series of simulations demonstrate that the EDA-VNS hybrid outperforms existing algorithms in terms of efficiency and solution quality, validating the significance of the integrated strategies.

We consider different types of job availability, namely item and batch availability. As objective function, we use both regular and nonregular criteria. For such problems we apply insertion techniques combined with beam search. Especially we consider different insertion orders of the operations or jobs.

      "summary": "This paper investigates insertion techniques for job shop scheduling problems where setup times are required due to job processing order. Traditional scheduling typically relies on priority rules, but recent experiments suggest that insertion algorithms—where operations are systematically inserted into partial schedules—yield significantly better results. The authors specifically address job shop scheduling with sequence-independent setup times and examine both item and batch availability. In their approach, each job is assessed based on a defined technological route and a specific release date, with jobs categorized into distinct groups. They introduce multiple objectives for minimizing completion times, including regular and nonregular criteria such as makespan and weighted earliness/tardiness penalties.\n\nThe methodology incorporates a beam search technique to refine the scheduling process further, enhancing the insertion algorithm by allowing multiple operations to be inserted in parallel. A comparative study was conducted using a large dataset of test problems, wherein the proposed insertion methods were rigorously analyzed against established priority rules. The results indicated a substantial performance improvement of the insertion algorithms, particularly for complex scheduling scenarios characterized by limited job availability.\n\nKey findings demonstrate that the effectiveness of insertion strategies varies notably with the chosen objective function and the structure of the job shop problem. In scenarios where setup times play a critical role, the results indicate a compelling case for adopting insertion tactics over conventional priority rules. The authors conclude that while this area presents significant challenges, especially in optimizing for nonregular criteria, further research and development of iterative improvement algorithms based on local search could yield even more efficient solutions in job shop scheduling contexts.

Previous dynamic scheduling mainly focuses on constructing predictive models for machine unavailability, with little studies on the adaptive and self-learning capacities for changing scheduling environments. Therefore, a digital twin (DT) driven scheduling with a dynamic feedback mechanism is proposed, in which a reinforcement learning (RL) based adaptive scheduling is developed in DT to make corrective decisions for the disturbances during production runs. In the proposed architecture, the happening disturbance is first detected in the virtual layer by the status continuously updating in accordance with the physical workshop. Furthermore, the reschedule triggering condition is determined in real-time through the calculation of the progress deviations resulting from disturbances. For the scheduling approach, the distributed RL (DRL) based adaptive scheduling method is built to perceive the dynamic production status from the virtual environment and implement corrective strategies to hedge against the occurred disturbances.

The authors propose a dynamic scheduling mechanism leveraging digital twin (DT) technology combined with distributed reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms.

The proposed architecture consists of three main components: disturbance detection, reschedule triggering conditions, and the DRL-based rescheduling strategy. Disturbances are identified as either dominant (immediate disruptions, e.g., machine breakdowns) or recessive (gradual impacts, e.g., delays in job processing). The architecture employs real-time monitoring through IoT devices, with data fed into the digital twin, enabling agents to analyze production conditions and calculate progress deviations to determine when to trigger rescheduling actions.

      "abstract": "This paper discussed the contradictory between wait time for computation and solution quality in solving flexible job shop scheduling problems. In order to reconcile this contradictory, a novel scheduling strategy called Simultaneous Scheduling is proposed. At first, a fairly good solution is obtained in a short time and the solution is set as the temporary processing plan so that the machines can start to work as soon as possible. Then while the machines are running, the temporary plan is being improved with evolutionary algorithms continuously. Experiments on both static and dynamic scheduling problems are performed. The results show that simultaneous scheduling is effective and efficient.",
      "method": "Simultaneous Scheduling (SS), which focuses on paralleling the runtime of scheduling computing with the runtime of machines processing. An initial solution is obtained in a short time with simple heuristic algorithms, and while machines are processing, the scheduling scheme is improved with evolutionary algorithms (EAs).",

      "summary": "The paper addresses the challenge of balancing computation time and solution quality in flexible job shop scheduling problems (FJSP) and dynamic flexible job shop scheduling problems (DFJSP). Traditional evolutionary algorithms (EAs), such as Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS), provide strong solutions but require substantial computation time, especially as the problem size increases. The proposed Simultaneous Scheduling (SS) strategy aims to minimize this waiting time by initially deploying a quick, suboptimal solution that allows machines to begin processing while further refining the schedule concurrently with machine operation using EAs. The SS method incorporates two specific algorithms: GA-based Simultaneous Scheduling (GA-SS) and VNS-based Simultaneous Scheduling (VNS-SS), which were tested against static and dynamic scheduling scenarios using experimental setups involving datasets like the Brandimarte dataset for static FJSP and customized instances for DFJSP. Results indicated that SS significantly reduces wait time and improves computational efficiency. For static problems, VNS-SS demonstrated better outcomes against both GA-SS and traditional EA methods, suggesting that leveraging the processing time while improve scheduling in real-time yields high-performance metrics such as makespan. In DFJSP scenarios, GA-SS outperformed VNS-SS, showcasing its robustness in dynamic settings where job releases are stochastic. Overall, SS proved to be a highly effective scheduling approach, bridging gaps in traditional scheduling methods and enhancing practical applications in industrial settings where efficiency and responsiveness to job dynamics are paramount. Future work may involve extending the SS framework to incorporate more complex job shop environments and refining the EAs for enhanced convergence speed without sacrificing solution quality.",

      "abstract": "During recent years, distributed manufacturing optimization problems have been researched and applied in many fields, such as steelmaking system and textile production process. To solve the multi-objective distributed flexible job shop scheduling problem, a hybrid Pareto-based tabu search algorithm (HPTSA) is investigated to minimize four objectives simultaneously, i.e., the makespan, the maximal workload, the total workload, and the earliness/tardiness (E/T) criteria. In the proposed algorithm, several approaches considering both the problem characteristics and the objective features are used to initialize the group of solutions. Then, five types of neighborhood structures that consider both problem structures are developed to enhance the exploitation and exploration capabilities. In addition, a well-designed backward method is proposed to optimize the E/T criteria. Based on the realistic production data in the steelmaking system, several instances with different problem scales are randomly generated. Four efficient multi-objective optimization algorithms are selected to make detailed comparisons with the proposed HPTSA algorithm.

The authors present an improved version of the shifting bottleneck procedure (SB), termed the improved shifting bottleneck procedure (ISB), which offers a more efficient and effective approach to scheduling in job shops. A significant contribution of this research is the theorem proving that adaptations of the SB can yield feasible solutions for all instances of the JSSP. The methodology integrates a novel algorithm, the Schrage algorithm with disturbance (DS), which allows for a more flexible handling of job scheduling by slightly deviating from strict priority rules, leading to improved solutions.

The computational experiments conducted on benchmark scenarios of varying sizes demonstrate that ISB generally outperforms both the original SB and other existing algorithms in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency. Notably, ISB consistently finds better solutions, while ISBB improves solution accuracy in complex problem instances. The results point to the potential of combining ISB with other heuristic strategies, such as tabu search, for enhanced performance in future applications.

We develop a variable neighbourhood search (VNS) algorithm to solve JIT-JSS. The algorithm operates by decomposing JIT-JSS into smaller problems, obtaining optimal or near-optimal sequences of performing the operations for those smaller problems, and generating a schedule, i.e., determining the completion times of the operations, for JIT-JSS. The algorithm uses several neighbourhood structures, including the new relaxation neighbourhoods developed in this study, to obtain a quality sequence. The relaxation neighbourhoods partially destruct (relax) the sequence and then re-construct (sequence) certain operations. Differing from the classical neighbourhoods, in which manipulations are performed either randomly or myopically, the moves in the new neighbourhoods are made with reference to other operations, so their impacts on the whole sequence are well considered. By solving a set of 72 benchmark instances, ranging from 10 to 20 jobs and 20 to 200 operations, and comparing the outcomes of the proposed algorithm with the state-of-the-art solution methods in the literature, we obtain new best solutions for nearly 57% of the instances, including new best solutions for 80% of the instances with 20 jobs.

Numerical experiments demonstrate the method’s potential, with solutions achieved within a limited number of vertices explored—indicating not only the algorithm's effectiveness but also its practicality for implementation.

Job shop scheduling has a wide range of applications such as order picking in the warehouse and vaccine delivery scheduling under a pandemic. In real-world applications, the production environment is often complex due to dynamic events such as job arrivals over time and machine breakdown. Scheduling heuristics, e.g., dispatching rules, have been popularly used to prioritise the candidates such as machines in manufacturing to make good schedules efficiently. Genetic programming, has shown its superiority in learning scheduling heuristics for job shop scheduling automatically due to its flexible representation. This survey firstly provides comprehensive discussions of recent designs of genetic programming algorithms on different types of job shop scheduling. In addition, we notice that in the recent years, a range of machine learning techniques such as feature selection and multitask learning, have been adapted to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of scheduling heuristic design with genetic programming. However, there is no survey to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of these recent approaches.

The authors examine the integration of machine learning techniques such as feature selection and multitask learning to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of scheduling heuristic design, addressing limitations of traditional heuristics that require domain-specific knowledge.

Traditional scheduling approaches struggle to cope with environmental changes such as machine failures or rework requirements, often necessitating a complete reschedule, resulting in inefficiency. This paper tackles the JSP by introducing a dynamic scheduling method that leverages deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques, specifically the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm. By framing the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), the authors capture job processing and state information through matrices representing job statuses, designated machines, and processing times, allowing for a more flexible scheduling approach. The PPO model is adapted to manage high-dimensional state and action spaces efficiently, mitigating the 'curse of dimensionality' and enabling real-time decision-making. Simulation results highlight the effectiveness of DRL, showing superior adaptability and performance in minimizing makespan when compared to traditional heuristic and meta-heuristic algorithms like genetic algorithms. Experimentation on various standard benchmarks reveals that the DRL-based strategy not only achieves competitive makespan outcomes but also demonstrates a capability for ongoing adaptability, essential for smart manufacturing environments. The findings advocate for DRL applications in operational scheduling, with implications for real-time production environments demanding rapid responses to variable conditions.

      "abstract": "Simulation Optimization (SO) techniques refer to a set of methods that have been applied to stochastic optimization problems, structured so that the optimizer(s) are integrated with simulation experiments. Although SO techniques provide promising solutions for large and complex stochastic problems, the simulation model execution is potentially expensive in terms of computation time. Thus, the overall purpose of this research is to advance the evolutionary SO methods literature by researching the use of metamodeling within these techniques. Accordingly, we present a new Evolutionary Learning Based Simulation Optimization (ELBSO) method embedded within Ordinal Optimization. In ELBSO a Machine Learning (ML) based simulation metamodel is created using Genetic Programming (GP) to replace simulation experiments aimed at reducing computation. ELBSO is evaluated on a Stochastic Job Shop Scheduling Problem (SJSSP), which is a well-known complex production planning problem in most industries such as semiconductor manufacturing. To build the metamodel from SJSSP instances that replace simulation replications, we employ a novel training vector to train GP. This then is integrated into an evolutionary two-phased Ordinal Optimization approach to optimize an SJSSP which forms the ELBSO method. Using a variety of experimental SJSSP instances, ELBSO is compared with evolutionary optimization methods from the literature and typical dispatching rules. Our findings include the superiority of ELBSO over all other algorithms in terms of the quality of solutions and computation time.

The GSS problem encompasses both job shop scheduling (JSS) and open shop scheduling (OSS) as special cases. ACO_GSS enhances the standard ACO framework by utilizing a MAX-MIN ant system with a neighborhood structure derived from previous job shop scheduling work.

Through extensive experimentation using real-world and synthetic problem instances, the authors establish the superiority of ACO_GSS in OSS contexts, achieving improvements over existing solutions in 15 out of 28 tested instances. The results indicate competitive performance relative to a state-of-the-art tabu search adaptation for job shop problems. The algorithm demonstrates robust outcomes across various problem sizes while indicating room for further optimization in JSS contexts. Practical implications include the feasibility of deploying ACO_GSS in industrial scheduling systems, where adaptive solution methodologies provide significant operational time savings.

      "abstract": "Flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSP) has attracted many research interests, in particular for meta-heuristic algorithm (MA) developers due to the superior optimization performance. Dragonfly algorithm (DA) is one of recent and popular MA approaches. However, it is inevitable for DA to be trapped into local optima, especially when dealing with the complex large-scale flexible job shop scheduling problem (LSFJSP). In this paper, an improved DA, adopting a dynamic opposite learning (DOL) strategy, is proposed (namely DOLDA) to solve the LSFJSP. DOL strategy is embedded into the population initialization stage and the generation jumping stage to raise the search ability of DA. This paper uses a T-test to testify whether there are differences between the proposed algorithm and other comparison algorithms, comparison results indicate that DOLDA shows noticeable differences with other algorithms that explain the effectiveness and innovation of the proposed algorithm. The jump rate is an important parameter that determines the probability of algorithms escaping from the algorithms’ local optimal solution. This paper also considers the jump rate analysis experiments to maximize the power of the DOLDA. 28 test functions from CEC 2013 and CEC 2014 are applied to verify the performance of DOLDA, test results reveal that DOLDA owns strong search ability in coping with almost all test functions. The DOLDA also is applied to solve 15 LSFJSP instances generated by Brandimate rule, the results obtained show that DOLDA can efficiently achieve a better solution on the LSFJSP compare to compared algorithms.",

Key innovations include the integration of DOL into both the initialization and update stages of the DA, thereby enhancing the ability to search various solutions in the solution space dynamically. The methodology was rigorously validated through extensive computational experiments involving 28 benchmark functions from CEC 2013 and CEC 2014, as well as 15 real-world-like LSFJSP instances generated using the Brandimarte rule. The results demonstrated that DOLDA not only outperformed several classical algorithms but also exhibited robust stability across various test scenarios.

As car production demand diversifies, manufacturing processes require high flexibility. An alternative to a conventional production line, matrix-structured production system provides a flexible manufacturing environment. In this system, until the final assembly operation is completed, each autonomous mobile robot (AMR) is assigned to a single car body and transports among various workstations to accomplish its given operations. These operations require sequential procedure and can be performed at multiple workstations. Therefore, assigning AMRs to appropriate workstations and operations is the key decision making that determines the capacity of the plants. In this paper, we formulate the Markov decision process (MDP) model for the flexible job shop scheduling problem with a single AMR and get the optimal policy by applying dynamic programming.

Due to energy efficient and productivity significantly affect the profits of enterprises, two criteria (i.e., makespan and total energy consumption) are used to evaluate the DJSSP. In this paper, a mixed integer programming model is developed, and a multi-objective artificial bee colony algorithm (MOABC) is proposed to evaluate the trade-off between the two objectives. In the MOABC, a solution encoding is represented by three parts: a factory assignment vector, a job permutation vector and a machine speed selection matrix. Meanwhile, a solution decoding is designed to present the scheduling scheme. A numerical experiment is designed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed MOABC. The experimental result demonstrates that the proposed MOABC can generate better Pareto solutions than NSGA-II and SPEA2 for the DJSSP.",

      "summary": "The research addresses the Distributed Job Shop Scheduling Problem (DJSSP), which is an extension of the classic Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). The problem involves coordinating multiple jobs across several factories, where jobs must be assigned not only to machines but also to specific factories while minimizing two critical objectives: makespan and total energy consumption (TEC). The authors develop a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model that incorporates variable machine speed settings, allowing for the exploration of trade-offs between processing speed and energy usage. The proposed solution methodology is a modified Multi-Objective Artificial Bee Colony algorithm (MOABC), which adapts the standard artificial bee colony algorithm to the discrete nature of job scheduling. This modification includes custom encoding strategies tailored for the problem domain and employs a fast non-dominant sorting method to efficiently identify Pareto-optimal solutions. A practical numerical experiment validates the effectiveness of this approach, showing that the MOABC outperforms traditional methods such as NSGA-II and SPEA2, producing superior Pareto solutions. The proposed MOABC captures a diverse set of solutions, enabling decision-makers to strategize around energy efficiency while maintaining productivity. This work is significant as it not only contributes to the scheduling literature by addressing the multi-factory context but also emphasizes the importance of energy efficiency in manufacturing systems. Future research could explore the applicability of the proposed method in real-world scenarios, examining its adaptability to varying machine characteristics and production environments.",

      "abstract": "The job shop scheduling problem (JSSP) has been a hot issue in manufacturing. For the past few decades, scholars have been attracted to research JSSP and proposed many novel meta-heuristic algorithms to solve it. Whale optimization algorithm (WOA) is such a novel meta-heuristic algorithm and has been proven to be efficient in solving real-world optimization problems in the literature. This paper proposes a hybrid WOA enhanced with Lévy flight and differential evolution (WOA-LFDE) to solve JSSP. By changing the expression of Lévy flight and DE search strategy, Lévy flight enhances the abilities of global search and convergence of WOA in iteration, while DE algorithm improves the exploitation and local search capabilities of WOA and keeps the diversity of solutions to escape local optima. It is then applied to solve 88 JSSP benchmark instances and compared with other state-of-art algorithms. The experimental results and statistical analysis show that the proposed algorithm has superior performance over contesting algorithms.",

      "summary": "The paper addresses the job shop scheduling problem (JSSP), a noted NP-hard challenge in manufacturing that has received significant attention over the years due to its complexity. The authors introduce a novel hybrid optimization algorithm that integrates the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) with Lévy Flight and Differential Evolution (DE) to improve both exploration and exploitation during the optimization process. WOA, inspired by the hunting techniques of humpback whales, is known for its efficient global search capabilities. However, to overcome its weaknesses, particularly premature convergence and local optima entrapment, the authors incorporate Lévy flight as a mechanism to enhance the global search abilities of WOA, and DE for improving local search and diversity.\n\nThe proposed WOA-LFDE algorithm modifies the existing WOA framework by adopting a Lévy flight distribution to facilitate better search patterns and combining it with DE to bolster local optimization capabilities. Through thorough experimentation on 88 JSSP benchmark instances, the authors compare the performance of WOA-LFDE against several state-of-the-art algorithms. The results demonstrate that WOA-LFDE outperforms the competition across various metrics, confirming its efficacy for JSSP.\n\nIn detail, the WOA encompasses two main phases: exploration, characterized by global searching behaviors, and exploitation, focusing on local refinements. The integration of Lévy flights allows the algorithm to sample potential solutions more effectively across the search space. Meanwhile, DE contributes its strength in local search, thereby maintaining a robust population of solutions and preventing stagnation.\n\nThis hybrid algorithm exhibits significant improvements, with experimental findings indicating enhanced solution quality and computational efficiency compared to traditional methods. The implications of these findings suggest that WOA-LFDE not only advances the state of JSSP resolution methodologies but also encourages further exploration of hybrid approaches in tackling complex optimization problems. Future research directions could include expanding the algorithm's applications to other combinatorial optimization problems and further refining its parameters to enhance performance even more.",

      "title": "A Decomposition Method for Makespan Minimization in Job-Shop Scheduling Problem Using Ising Machine",
      "abstract": "To cope with daily changes in manufacturing production orders and plans, more efficient scheduling of production is highly required. The job-shop scheduling problem (JSP) provides a way to solve the production planning problem automatically, and the makespan criterion is an important metric for evaluating production efficiency. Several studies on the JSP using an Ising machine have been reported, but it is difficult to minimize the makespan by using an Ising machine. In this paper, we present a new method for minimizing the makespan in the JSP using an Ising machine. The makespan minimization problem is decomposed into two problems, the minimum makespan estimation problem and the constraint satisfaction problem. These problems are repeatedly solved until the solution converges to a sub-optimal result or until the termination conditions are satisfied. Experimental comparison with a commercial-based solver demonstrated that the proposed method is up to 5.2 times faster.",

      "objectives": "To minimize the makespan in job-shop scheduling while efficiently handling daily changes in production schedules.",
      "summary": "The job-shop scheduling problem (JSP) is critical for efficient production planning, especially in environments where manufacturing orders change frequently. Traditional approaches to minimizing makespan typically rely on exact methods that can be computationally intensive or heuristic methods that lack optimality assurance. The introduction of Ising machines, which leverage quantum computing principles, provides an exciting avenue for optimization. However, using Ising machines directly for makespan minimization in JSP has inherent challenges due to the need for binary variable formulations. The present work introduces a novel decomposition approach that splits the makespan minimization problem into two parts, a master-problem focusing on estimating the minimum makespan and a sub-problem for the constraint satisfaction aspect. This technique enables the iterative resolution of the problems, progressively refining the makespan estimation until an acceptable sub-optimal solution is reached or the specified termination criteria are met. The study demonstrates the practical effectiveness of this method through experiments that confirm its speed, achieving results that are up to 5.2 times faster than traditional commercial solvers. The method's reliance on the quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) model allows for efficient handling of complex problem parameters using Ising technology. Key findings reveal that this approach not only fulfills the requirements of minimizing makespan but also adapits swiftly to real-time scheduling needs, thereby paving the way for future research and applications in optimization tasks involving adaptive manufacturing scenarios.",

The motivation arises from increasing demands for flexible and sustainable manufacturing processes amidst changing operational constraints such as energy costs and resource management. The proposed method intelligently utilizes reinforcement learning techniques where agents represent production machinery and their interactions are modeled to ensure optimal solving of scheduling problems while minimizing energy costs and managing deadlines. Key performance metrics considered include makespan, energy consumption, and product lateness. Experiments were carried out using simulated job-shop scenarios with varying target optimization criteria across multiple trials that structured agent-learning behavior against traditional heuristics like First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) and Shortest Job Next (SJN). Results demonstrate that the MARL approach, particularly when focused on energy management, achieves reduced energy costs and operational efficiency, although it may lead to increased lateness in certain configurations. This underscores the complexity of balancing conflicting metrics in sustainable production environments. The significance of this study lies in its practical implications: providing manufacturers with advanced, adaptable scheduling strategies that respond to real-time constraints and sustainability goals, aiding in the transition towards greener industrial practices.

      "abstract": "This paper concerns the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) considering the transportation times of the jobs from one machine to another. The goal of a basic JSSP is to determine starting and ending times for each job in which the objective function can be optimized. In here, several Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) have been employed to transfer the jobs between machines and warehouse located at the production environment. Unlike the advantages of implemented automatic transportation system, if they are not controlled along the routes, it is possible that the production system encounters breakdown. Therefore, the Conflict-Free Routing Problem (CFRP) for AGVs is considered as well as the basic JSSP. Hence, we proposed a mathematical model which is composed of JSSP and CFRP, simultaneously and since the problem under study is NP-hard, a two stage Ant Colony Algorithm (ACA) is also proposed. The objective function is to minimize the total completion time (make-span). Eventually, in order to show the model and algorithm’s efficiency, the computational results of 13 test problems and sensitivity analysis are exhibited. The obtained results show that ACA is an efficient meta-heuristic for this problem, especially for the large-sized problems.

      "abstract": "The fuzzy job shop scheduling problem with makespan minimisation has received considerable attention over the last decade. Different sets of benchmark instances have been made available, and many metaheuristic solutions and corresponding upper bounds of the optimal makespan have been given for these instances in different publications. However, unlike the deterministic case, very little work has been invested in proposing and solving mathematical models for the fuzzy problem. This has resulted both in a lack of a good characterisation of the hardness of existing benchmark instances and in the absence of reliable lower and upper bounds for the makespan. In consequence, it is difficult, if not impossible to properly assess and compare new proposals of exact or approximate solving methods, thus hindering progress in this field. In this work we intend to fill this gap by proposing and solving two mathematical models, a mixed integer linear programming model and a constraint programming model. A thorough analysis on the scalability of solving these mathematical models with commercial solvers is carried out. A state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithm from the literature is also used as reference point for a better understanding of the results. Using solvers of different nature allows us to improve known upper and lower bounds for all existing instances, and certify optimality for many of them for the first time.

It identifies a significant gap in the existing literature, in which little attention has been paid to establishing mathematical models for the fuzzy version of the job shop problem, thus limiting the effectiveness of comparative assessments of new algorithms. To resolve this, the authors propose two mathematical models: one based on mixed integer linear programming (MILP) and another utilizing constraint programming (CP). These models are formulated to accommodate the uncertainties of processing times represented as fuzzy numbers, specifically triangular fuzzy numbers. The study employs state-of-the-art commercial solvers to analyze the scalability and performance of both models against previously established benchmark instances, totaling 149 instances that vary in size from 36 to 2000 tasks.\n\nThe research also highlights the significance of considering both exact algorithms (through MILP and CP) and heuristic approaches (using metaheuristics), suggesting that while the exact methods excel at smaller and medium-sized instances, the complexity of larger instances often necessitates the adoption of metaheuristics. The results reveal that the CP model generally outperforms the MILP model, providing more reliable bounds and achieving optimal solutions for many instances within acceptable time limits.\n\nImportantly, the work updates the best-known lower and upper bounds on the optimal makespan for all instances analyzed, with 83 instances certified as optimal for the first time, improving upon the existing literature significantly. The findings advocate for a comprehensive framework that melds various solving techniques for practical application in real-world scheduling scenarios, stressing the need for future research to focus on instance characteristics beyond size, such as the ratio of jobs to machines, which appears to affect the computational complexity.

      "abstract": "Flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSSP), as a variant of the job shop scheduling problem, has a larger solution space. Researchers are always looking for good methods to solve this problem. In recent years, the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been applied to solve various shop scheduling problems due to its advantages that fast solving speed and strong generalization ability. In this paper, we first propose a new DRL framework to realize representation learning and policy learning. The new framework adopts a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP) as the state embedding network to extract state information, which reduces the computational complexity of the algorithm to some extent. Next, we design a new state representation and define a new action space. The new state representation can directly reflect the state features of candidate actions, which is conducive for the agent to capture more effective state information and improve its decision-making ability. The new definition of action space can solve the two subproblems of the FJSSP simultaneously with only one action space. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the policy model on four public datasets: Barnes dataset, Brandimarte dataset, Dauzere dataset and Hurink dataset. Extensive experimental results on these public datasets show that the proposed method achieves a better compromise in terms of optimization ability and applicability compared to the composite priority dispatching rules and the existing state-of-the-art models.",

      "objectives": "The objective of this research is to develop an effective solution to the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problems (FJSSP) using a deep reinforcement learning approach, improving upon existing methods in terms of computational efficiency and solution quality.",
      "summary": "The paper addresses the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP), which is known for its NP-hard complexity and expansive solution space. Traditional exact methods, while precise, often suffer from high computational complexity that limits their practicality to small instances. Approximate methods, including heuristic and meta-heuristic approaches, provide faster solutions but typically yield lower quality outcomes. Recent advances in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) present an opportunity to navigate these complexities effectively due to their inherent ability to learn optimal policies from interaction with the environment. The authors introduce a novel DRL framework tailored to FJSSP that incorporates representation learning via a lightweight Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), thus reducing computational demands. This framework includes a new definition of state representation that captures essential features of candidate actions directly, improving an agent's decision-making abilities. Additionally, the action space is redefined to allow the simultaneous handling of two subproblems (operation sequencing and machine allocation) within a single framework, facilitating a more efficient learning process. Performance validation is carried out on various public datasets, including Barnes, Brandimarte, Dauzere, and Hurink datasets. Results illustrate that this new method not only improves upon the performance of traditional composite priority dispatching rules but also achieves competitive results compared to existing state-of-the-art models, indicating its potential for wider applications in FJSSP scenarios. Future work may explore extensions to multi-objective and dynamic FJSSP, enhancing the practical relevance of DRL in real-world scheduling contexts.",

      "abstract": "This paper studies the production scheduling problem in a flexible manufacturing system with two adjacent working areas, whose products are incorporated with flexible non-linear process plans and assembling operations. The basic parts are produced in one area before they are transported to the other area for assembly. The assembling structures of products are either flat or multi-levelled. Sequence-dependent setup times of operations and transition times of jobs between machines are considered separately from processing times. Lot streaming is considered beforehand such that each job represents a basic part instead of a batch of identical parts. Identical subassemblies are shared by all possible assembling operations, instead of being pre-associated with any product. Makespan, total tardiness and total workload are taken as objectives to be optimised. We propose a distributed ant colony system to solve the problem and explore the Pareto front. The approach is first compared with other methods, using several sets of hypothetical test cases with different sizes and complexities; then, it is applied to solve a ball valve production scheduling problem under different scenarios. We show that the proposed approach outperforms most of the other methods for the tested problems, especially for large-scale instances, making it a valuable and competitive approach for solving practical production scheduling problems.",

      "abstract": "Currently, the ageing population is getting higher attention in production systems due to the increasing percentage of the ageing workforce, which persists longer in the working environment. Older workers are more vulnerable because of a possible decrease in physical capacities but can have a higher experience level. It is important to evaluate these factors during production process decisions and adapt the working environment to such workers. In such a way, production systems performance and workers’ well-being are jointly achieved. In companies aiming to include these aspects, digitalisation and automation can provide tools that can be used at tactical, strategic or operational levels. For example, at the operational level, wearable sensors, smart devices or trackers can be used in analysing the working time, effort and physical fatigue of operators via human-energy expenditure. These measures can be used to assess the required recovery time. However, the most challenging step is to include these measures in the decision-making process to organise the working process for operators according to their profiles and health restrictions. In this paper, we show how fatigue can be incorporated into operational processes such as scheduling in the context of a Dual-Resource Constrained (DRC) job shop. We consider several models to integrate rest allowance into the scheduling process and present a heuristic approach to assign operations to workers and machines. The impact of rest allowance on system performance is measured and managerial insights are provided.",

      "objectives": "This paper investigates the effects of workforce differences from a physical and experience point of view by including them in the scheduling process in DRC, presenting a more realistic scheduling approach that considers fatigue effects and workers' experience. We aim to balance the workload among multi-skilled workers and assign Rest Allowance based on individual characteristics.",
      "summary": "This paper addresses the challenge posed by an ageing workforce within production systems, specifically regarding job-shop scheduling under dual-resource constraints. As the workforce ages, their physical capabilities may diminish even as their experience levels increase, prompting a need for a more tailored scheduling approach. The authors acknowledge that while digitalization and automation can help adapt production environments for older workers, the integration of their needs into operational scheduling remains problematic. The research focuses on incorporating fatigue—a byproduct of physical exertion—into the scheduling processes typical of Dual-Resource Constrained (DRC) job shops. Various models are proposed to embed Rest Allowance (RA) into conventional scheduling, providing a means to systematically include considerations for worker fatigue related to ageing. Key innovations include an easy-to-use heuristic method that delivers results suitable for practical industrial applications, balancing work assignments according to both physical characteristics and experience. The authors validate their approach through case studies, offering managerial insights into improving production performance whilst safeguarding worker well-being. The findings underscore the importance of reevaluating traditional scheduling practices to accommodate the unique profile of an ageing workforce, leading to potential improvements in both productivity and worker satisfaction. This research not only contributes to the literature on job-shop scheduling but also emphasizes the necessity of integrating human factors into production decision-making, thereby paving the way for more inclusive and adaptive operations management strategies for diverse workforce demographics.",

This study considers a job shop scheduling problem with reverse flows under uncertainty. Since the main parameter of the model (i.e., the processing time of operations) is tainted with a great degree of uncertainty in real-world applications, a robust programming approach is utilized. This paper proposes a computationally efficient model. Due to the complexity and difficulty of solving the presented model, an exact solution method for small-sized instances and simulated annealing (SA) and discrete harmony search (DHS) algorithms for medium- and large-sized instances are proposed. The model performance is evaluated by comparing the computational results with the literature. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed meta-heuristic algorithms is evaluated by comparing the resulted solutions with the exact method for small-sized instances and with three other meta-heuristic algorithms, such as discrete particle swarm optimization (DPSO) and invasive weed optimization (DIWO), and iterated greedy (IG) algorithms, for medium- and large-sized instances.

Thus, the flexible job-shop scheduling issue comes with fuzzy processing times. Fuzzy numbers are used to depict the uncertainty associated with processing times. This paper proposes a Hybrid Fuzzy Flexible job-shop Scheduling Approach (HFFSA) for addressing the Fuzzy Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling Problem (FFJSSP). An encoding-and-decoding scheme is employed for initializing the population. HFFSA incorporates four operators to enhance the quality of solutions: the Different Positions Shuffling (DPS) operator, the Randomly Selected Positions Shuffling (RSPS) operator, the Block Shuffling (BS) operator and the Inversion Mutation (IM) operator. The DPS operator shuffles the different positions between a randomly generated solution and the current one. On the other hand, the RSPS shuffles random positions to maintain population diversity. The BS and IM work on a subset of positions from the current solution to obtain near-optimal solutions. Furthermore, we integrate the pair-wise local search strategy with HFFSA to improve the best solution. HFFSA is compared to twenty-five algorithms using Lei and remanufacturing benchmarks. Several statistical measures are employed, like the CPU time, best, average and worst fuzzy makespan values, boxplots and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The statistical analyses affirm the superiority of the proposed HFFSA.",

      "summary": "The study addresses the Fuzzy Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling Problem (FFJSSP) by introducing a Hybrid Fuzzy Flexible Scheduling Approach (HFFSA) that implements four innovative operators aimed at optimizing solution quality in uncertain manufacturing environments where processing times can vary. Each operator plays a distinct role—increasing population diversity, optimizing solution permutations, and improving search capability. The DPS operator facilitates exploration by shuffling solutions to enhance diversity, while RSPS focuses on preserving population variation. The Block Shuffling (BS) allows for localized adjustments to exploit better solutions, and Inversion Mutation (IM) randomly selects and modifies segments of solutions to uncover higher-quality alternatives. The paper not only presents theoretical insights into the algorithmic structures but also rigorously evaluates HFFSA against 25 established algorithms using extensive benchmarks from Lei and remanufacturing cases. The statistical analysis, employing metrics such as fuzzy makespan values, confirms HFFSA's superior performance over other algorithms. The method's success is attributed to its balanced exploration-exploitation strategy and the coupling of local search enhancements. HFFSA is shown to perform efficiently while reducing computational overhead, making it a substantial contribution to scheduling literature and a promising approach for real-world application in complex manufacturing scenarios.

      "abstract": "In this paper, we are concerned with the resolution of a multiobjective complex job-shop scheduling problem stemming from semiconductor manufacturing. To produce feasible and industrially meaningful schedules, this paper extends the recently proposed batch-oblivious approach by considering unavailability periods and minimum time lags and by simultaneously optimizing multiple criteria that are relevant in the industrial context. A novel criterion on the satisfaction of production targets decided at a higher level is also proposed. Because the solution approach must be embedded in a real-time application, decision makers must express their preferences before the optimization phase. In addition, a preference model is introduced where trade-off is only allowed between some criteria. Two a priori multiobjective extensions of Simulated Annealing are proposed, which differ in how the simultaneous use of a lexicographic order and weights is handled when evaluating the fitness. A known a posteriori approach of the literature is used as a benchmark. All the metaheuristics are embedded in a Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure. The different versions of the archived GRASP approach are compared using large industrial instances. The numerical results show that the proposed approach provides good solutions regarding the preferences.

Previous methods, notably those developed by Elmaghraby and Park, and later by Barnes and Brennan, used a branch and bound approach that, although effective, was computationally expensive due to its reliance on extensive enumeration and permutations of job orders.\n\nThe authors introduce a novel branching scheme that significantly reduces computation by focusing directly on job allocation to machines—termed Scheme 2—in contrast to the previous Scheme 1, which relied on generating eligible partial permutations. This new method allows for a combined approach to job scheduling while maintaining optimality, thereby yielding a reduced number of schedules to evaluate computationally. The authors also propose an improved lower bound that is straightforward to calculate, thus enhancing the overall efficacy of the algorithm.\n\nThe practical implications of this new approach are underscored by extensive computational experiments, which illustrate that the proposed scheme can solve larger instances of the scheduling problem within feasible time limits, something that proved challenging for the previous methods under similar constraints. The results presented indicate that the computational time required using the new method is several times less than that required by the existing methods, demonstrating its superiority in performance. This advancement in scheduling algorithms not only provides a more efficient means of solving these problems but also opens avenues for further research in optimizing more complex scheduling scenarios.

      "abstract": "Distributed flexible job shop scheduling has attracted research interest due to the development of global manufacturing. However, constraints including crane transportation and energy consumption should be considered with the realistic requirements. To address this issue, first, we modeled the problem by utilizing an integer programming method, wherein the makespan and energy consumptions during the machine process and crane transportation are optimized simultaneously. Afterward, a hybrid algorithm consisting of estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) and variable neighborhood search (VNS) was proposed to solve the problem, where an identification rule of four crane conditions was designed to make fitness calculation feasible. In EDA compo-nent, the parameters in probability matrices are set to be self-adaptive for stable convergence to obtain better output. Moreover, a probability mechanism was applied to control the activity of the EDA component. In VNS component, five problem-specific neighborhood structures including global and local strategies are employed to enhance exploitation ability. The simulation tests results confirmed that the proposed hybrid EDA-VNS algorithm can solve the considered problem with high efficiency compared with other competitive algorithms, and the proposed improving strategies are verified to have significance in better performance.",

      "summary": "The study addresses the complex problem of distributed flexible job shop scheduling (DFJSP) with crane transportations, which has gained interest as global manufacturing evolves. Recognizing that traditional scheduling methods often overlook constraints such as crane transportation and energy usage, the authors propose a novel hybrid algorithm that integrates an Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) with a Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) approach. This hybridization is necessary due to the NP-hard nature of the DFJSPC, particularly under crane operation constraints. The problem is first modeled using integer programming, focusing on optimizing both makespan and total energy consumption (TEC) across machine processes. Notably, the EDA is designed to identify superior individuals from a population based on fitness, employing self-adaptive parameter settings in probability matrices to enhance convergence stability and solution quality. The VNS complements EDA's explorative strengths with refined local searches through multiple problem-specific neighborhood structures. Five such structures enhance the algorithm's ability to exploit promising areas of the solution space. Testing against other competitive algorithms showcases the hybrid EDA-VNS method's efficiency, offering significant advancements in performance for the DFJSPC. Key contributions include the development of an efficient identification rule for crane conditions, a self-adaptive probability mechanism for EDA activity control, and an exploration-exploitation balance that is vital for overcoming traditional algorithm shortcomings. Future implications could see expanded applications in various manufacturing industries, emphasizing the need for sustainable and energy-efficient production practices.",

      "title": "DeepMAG: Deep reinforcement learning with multi-agent graphs for flexible job shop scheduling",
      "abstract": "The flexible job shop scheduling (FJSS) is important in real-world factories due to the wide applicability. FJSS schedules the operations of jobs to be executed by specific machines at the appropriate time slots based on two decision steps, namely, the job sequencing (i.e., the sequence of jobs executed on a machine) and the job routing (i.e., the route of a job to a machine). Most current studies utilize either deep reinforcement learning (DRL) or multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for FJSS with a large search space. However, these studies suffer from two major limitations: no integration between DRL and MARL, and independent agents without cooperation. To this end, we propose a new model for FJSS, called DeepMAG based on Deep reinforcement learning with Multi-Agent Graphs. DeepMAG has two key contributions. (1) Integration between DRL and MARL. DeepMAG integrates DRL with MARL by associating a different agent to each machine and job. Each agent exploits DRL to find the best action on the job sequencing and routing. After a job-associated agent chooses the best machine, the job becomes a job candidate for the machine to proceed to its next operation, while a machine-associated agent selects the next job from its job candidate set to be processed. (2) Cooperative agents. A multi-agent graph is built based on the operation relationships among machines and jobs. An agent cooperates with its neighboring agents to take one cooperative action. Finally, we conduct experiments to evaluate the performance of DeepMAG and experimental results show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques.",
      "method": "DeepMAG integrates deep reinforcement learning with multi-agent reinforcement learning using a multi-agent graph to enable cooperation among agents, assigning one agent to each machine and job.

This allows simultaneous decision-making while leveraging cooperative relationships among agents represented in graphs that illustrate operations among jobs and machines.",

      "summary": "The paper presents DeepMAG, an innovative model for flexible job shop scheduling (FJSS) that combines deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to effectively manage complex scheduling tasks in real-world manufacturing environments. Traditional scheduling methods often face severe limitations due to the lack of integration between DRL and MARL, causing inefficiencies in dealing with the large state and action spaces associated with FJSS. DeepMAG addresses these challenges by establishing a cooperative system of agents, each representing a specific job or machine, and integrating their decision-making processes through a multi-agent graph structure that captures the operational relationships between jobs and machines. The architecture leverages distinct Deep Q Networks to optimize job sequencing and routing, allowing agents to collaboratively determine the best actions based on shared information from their graph representation. The experimental validation of DeepMAG, conducted using simulated data reflective of real-world factory settings, demonstrates significant performance improvements over existing state-of-the-art techniques, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed integration of DRL and MARL. Overall, the model contributes to the growing field of advanced manufacturing and scheduling by providing a scalable and efficient solution that adapts dynamically to production demands and operational constraints. Future work will expand upon the foundation laid by DeepMAG to explore adaptations for dynamic FJSS scenarios involving real-time changes such as job insertions and machine failures, enhancing the model’s application robustness in varied manufacturing conditions.",

Efficient flexible job shop scheduling plays a crucial role in making quick responses to production orders with low volume and high variety. When producing complex assembly products that are comprised of multiple and multilevel intermediate parts organized as tree-structure Bills-Of-Materials (BOMs), jobs get restricted by hierarchical precedence constraints due to dependencies between manufactured parts. To cope with this condition, this paper formulates a flexible job shop scheduling problem with job precedence constraints (FJSSP-JPC). A novel shuffled cellular evolutionary grey wolf optimizer (SCEGWO) is proposed to solve FJSSP-JPC with the objective of minimizing makespan. Schedule solutions are encoded as elaborately designed triple-vectors involving the information of job sequencing, grouped operation sequencing and machine assignment, while the satisfactions of job precedence constraints are guaranteed by binary sort tree-based repair mechanism. In SCEGWO, each individual interacts with its topological cellular neighborhood by conducting a micro discrete variant of grey wolf optimizer (GWO), causing that the whole population is decomposed into multiple subpopulations which communicate by the neighborhood overlapping.

      "abstract": "In a flexible job-shop scheduling problem (FJSP), an operation can be assigned to one of a set of eligible machines. Therefore, the problem is to simultaneously determine both the assignment of operations to machines and their sequences. Accordingly, the solution encoding of many regular genetic algorithms (RGAs) developed in literature has two parts: one part encodes the assignment decision and the other the sequencing decision. The genetic search determines both the assignment and the sequencing of the operations simultaneously through a random process guided by the principles of natural selection and evolution. In this paper, we develop a two-stage genetic algorithm (2SGA) with the first stage being different from a typical RGA for FJSP found in the literature. The first stage of 2SGA has a solution encoding that only dictates the sequence in which the operations are considered for assignment. Whenever an operation is considered for assignment, the machine that can complete this operation the soonest is selected while taking into account the operations that are already assigned to this machine. The order in which the operations are assigned to machines determines their sequence. The second stage, starting from the solutions of the first stage, follows the common approach of genetic algorithm for FJSP to enable the algorithm to search the entire solution space by including solutions that might have been excluded because of the greedy nature of the first stage. We tested the proposed algorithm by solving many benchmark problems and several other large-size problems of a comprehensive FJSP model with sequence-dependent setup, machine release date, and lag-time. The performance of the proposed two-stage algorithm greatly exceeds that of the common approach of genetic algorithm for FJSP. We also show that further performance improvement of the proposed algorithm can be achieved using high-performance parallel computation. However, the more interesting result we found was that the sequential version of the proposed algorithm (using a single CPU) outperformed a parallel implementation of the regular genetic algorithm that uses many CPUs. We also noted that the superiority of the proposed algorithm over RGA is much greater when solving large-size problems, rendering the proposed algorithm as a viable choice for solving practical problems that are typically encountered in industries.",

To overcome these limitations, the authors propose a novel two-stage genetic algorithm (2SGA) characterized by an innovative solution encoding method in its first stage, which focuses purely on operational sequencing. This method allows the algorithm to select machines based on the earliest completion times of the operations while considering previously assigned tasks to each machine.

Traditionally, scheduling techniques used uniform Priority Dispatching Rules (PDR), which resulted in suboptimal performance. In response, the authors propose a new approach using multiple PDRs tailored to individual machines on the shop floor. The methodology includes the development of a simulation model whereby different dispatching rules are tested across scenarios with an extensive database for training an inference model that can predict the optimal rule based on specific scheduling conditions. This simulation-based strategy allows for dynamic adaptation of rules, aiming to reduce makespan significantly compared to traditional methods. Experimental results show that utilizing varied dispatching rules for each machine can improve scheduling outcomes, achieving a reduction in makespan in 38% of the tested scenarios and demonstrating a range of improvement of 1% to 8% over the best single rule from previous studies. Performance metrics illustrate the effectiveness of this approach over conventional methods, validating the benefit of a more holistic consideration of dispatching rules tailored to individual machine characteristics. Future work aims to refine this model by integrating it with data mining techniques to enable real-time decision-making, thus further enhancing adaptive responses in dynamic scheduling environments. Furthermore, a goal is set to establish an intelligent decision support system that eliminates the need for repeated simulations by leveraging historical data to guide dispatching rule selection efficiently.",

      "summary": "In this paper, Dauzere-Peres and Lasserre introduce a modified shifting bottleneck (MSB) procedure aimed at optimizing job-shop scheduling, which is critical in various manufacturing and production environments. The original shifting bottleneck procedure, developed by Adams et al., has shown superior performance in scheduling jobs across multiple machines while minimizing makespan (the total time required to complete a set of tasks). However, this technique harbors certain limitations, particularly regarding its handling of job dependencies and variability in performance tied to the number of optimization cycles employed.\n\nThe authors tackle these issues by extending Carlier's algorithm, which is integral to the original SB method. By modifying this algorithm, the authors allow for precedence relations between jobs, ensuring that the sequencing of tasks respects these dependencies. They show that their modifications help guarantee a monotonic decrease in makespan during re-optimization cycles, thereby addressing the erratic behavior observed in the traditional SB method.\n\nA series of computational tests were conducted using well-known problem instances (the 10 jobs, 10 machines and 5 jobs, 20 machines problems) to evaluate the effectiveness of the MSB procedure against both the standard SB method and other heuristics. Results indicated that the MSB procedure consistently yielded better or comparable performance across various scenarios, demonstrating robustness against the number of optimization cycles utilized. For instance, the authors report a makespan improvement from 1015 in the standard SB to 950 using their MSB algorithm for the 10x10 problem, corroborated by achieving results closer to optimal solutions in other instances.\n\nThe implications of this research extend to practical applications in scheduling where dependencies are prevalent, making the MSB procedure a valuable addition to operational research methodologies used in job-shop scheduling. The authors suggest avenues for future work that may include further enhancement of the algorithm's efficiency and application to other scheduling contexts.",

      "abstract": "In this work, a multi-objective discrete Jaya algorithm (MODJA) is proposed to address the flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSSP) considering the minimization of makespan, total workload of machines, and workload of critical machine as performance measures. A discrete Jaya algorithm is proposed to handle the problem under consideration. A problem specific neighborhood-based local search technique is integrated into the proposed approach to enhance its exploitation capability. Further, a dynamic mutation operator and a modified crowding distance measure are proposed to enhance the diversity in the search process. Extensive computational experiments are carried out considering 203 instances of FJSSP from literature. The Taguchi method of design is employed to identify the best set of key parameters based on three instances. In the experimentation phase, initially, the contribution of the proposed local search technique and crowding distance measure is investigated. Then, a comparison of MODJA with the weighted sum version of the approach and other multi-objective evolutionary algorithms is performed. Computational results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MODJA in obtaining diverse and improved Pareto-optimal solutions.",

      "summary": "This paper addresses the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP) using a novel multi-objective discrete Jaya algorithm (MODJA). The core problem involves scheduling multiple jobs on multiple machines with the goal of minimizing makespan, total workload on machines, and workload on the critical machine. The FJSSP is recognized as NP-hard due to its complexity and relevance in real-world manufacturing scenarios. The authors propose several significant enhancements to traditional Jaya algorithm strategies tailored for multi-objective optimization. A primary innovation is the incorporation of a neighborhood-based local search technique that improves the search's exploitation capabilities, aiming to iteratively refine solutions once initial candidates are generated. Additionally, the modifications include developing a dynamic mutation operator and an updated crowding distance measure to maintain diversity among potential solutions and prevent premature convergence. Through extensive testing of 203 instances sourced from existing literature, the authors apply the Taguchi method to tune algorithm parameters effectively. The computational experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms traditional weighted-sum approaches and several other evolutionary algorithms concerning solution diversity and Pareto-optimality. The study validates that the localized search strategies amplify the foundational strengths of MODJA, particularly in diverse scheduling environments. The findings have practical implications for industrial scheduling operations, suggesting that the MODJA could serve as a robust tool for production managers seeking efficient scheduling solutions. The research outlines future avenues, including further refinements to the algorithm and potential adaptations for real-time scheduling adjustments, thus promising greater applicability in dynamic manufacturing settings.",

      "summary": "This paper focuses on the flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSSP), an NP-hard problem relevant in various industries like automotive and textiles. Particularly, it examines the stochastic variant (SFJSSP) where operation processing times are uncertain. The study proposes a novel simheuristic approach, integrating Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) with a Jaya Algorithm (JA), aiming to minimize expected makespan despite inherent uncertainty. The proposed methodology performs incredibly well, especially under varying levels of process time variability, made feasible through simulations that utilize reliability-based metrics such as box plots and survival functions to analyze solution performance. A critical aspect of the work is the algorithm’s adaptability, as it allows for the use of flexible probability distributions such as Weibull and log-normal, thereby accounting for real-world uncertainties more accurately compared to traditional deterministic models. Experimentation involved an extensive set of well-known FJSSP benchmark instances modified to fit the stochastic context, demonstrating how performance metrics reflect the algorithm's efficiency and robustness across different scenarios. The SimJAYA algorithm is noted for its ability to deliver acceptable solutions for larger problem instances under stringent computational timelines. Significant findings include the ability to draw comparative analyses between deterministic and stochastic scenarios, illustrating the impact of variability in processing times on overall schedule performance. The paper concludes by highlighting practical applications in manufacturing and offers suggestions for future research directions that include refining algorithm adaptability in dynamic environments and exploring its applicability across diverse optimization problems beyond scheduling, emphasizing the ongoing need for efficient solutions to complex real-world operational challenges.",
