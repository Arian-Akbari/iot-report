      "title": "Stochastic Neural Networks for Solving JobShop Scheduling: Part 1. Problem Representation",
      "abstract": "This paper presents an application of neural networks in solving jobshop scheduling, an npcomplete optimization problem with constraint satisfaction. In particular, we introduce a neural computation architecture based on a stochastic Hopfield neural network model. First, the job-shop problem is mapped into a 2-dimensional matrix representation of neurons similar to those for solving the traveling salesman problem (TSP). Constant positive and negative current biases are applied to specific neurons as excitations and inhibitions, respectively, to enforce the operation precedence relationships. At the convergence of neural network, the solution to the jobshop problem is represented by a set of cost function trees encoded in the matrix of stable states. Each node in the set of trees represents a job, and each link represents the interdependency between jobs. The cost attached to each link is a function of the processing time of a particular job. The starting time of each job can be determined by traversing the paths leading to the root node of the tree. A computation circuit computes the total completion times (costs) of all jobs, and the cost difference is added to the energy function of the stochastic neural network. Using a simulated annealing algorithm, the temperature of the system is slowly decreased according to an annealing schedule until the energy of the system is at a local or global minimum. By choosing an appropriate annealing schedule, near-optimal and optimal solutions to job-shop problems can be found.",

      "summary": "This paper addresses the complex, NP-complete nature of job-shop scheduling problems through the innovative application of neural networks, specifically a stochastic Hopfield neural network model. The authors present a unique mapping of the job-shop problem into a 2-dimensional matrix structure of neurons, which bears resemblance to previous models used in solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). This framework employs constant positive and negative biases on the neurons to simulate excitatory and inhibitory relationships, respecting the precedence constraints of operations involved in job completion. In this setup, each stable state of the neural network corresponds to a valid job-shop solution, represented through cost function trees. With each node denoting a job and links indicating dependencies between jobs, the total cost can be derived by managing the operation timings through tree traversal. The energy function of the stochastic neural network is adjusted by incorporating the computed total job completion costs, thus guiding the network towards optimal or near-optimal solutions. A simulated annealing algorithm supports the optimization process, gradually lowering the system's temperature in adherence to a specified cooling schedule, a critical component for achieving convergence towards minimum energy states. The approach for optimally solving job-shop scheduling via this neural network structure presents significant implications for real-world applications where scheduling efficiency is paramount, such as manufacturing processes and project management. This first installment sets the stage for a more detailed exploration in the subsequent part of their work, which will delve into the architectural specifics of the neural computation network and assess the efficacy of the presented methodology through simulation outcomes.",

      "title": "Real-Time Scheduling for Dynamic Partial-No-Wait Multiobjective Flexible Job Shop by Deep Reinforcement Learning",
      "abstract": "In modern discrete flexible manufacturing systems, dynamic disturbances frequently occur in real time and each job may contain several special operations in partial-no-wait constraint due to technological requirements. In this regard, a hierarchical multiagent deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based real-time scheduling method named hierarchical multi-agent proximal policy optimization (HMAPPO) is developed to address the dynamic partial-no-wait multiobjective flexible job shop scheduling problem (DMOFJSP-PNW) with new job insertions and machine breakdowns. The proposed HMAPPO contains three proximal policy optimization (PPO)-based agents operating in different spatiotemporal scales, namely, objective agent, job agent, and machine agent. The objective agent acts as a higher controller periodically determining the temporary objectives to be optimized. The job agent and machine agent are lower actuators, respectively, choosing a job selection rule and machine assignment rule to achieve the temporary objective at each rescheduling point. Five job selection rules and six machine assignment rules are designed to select an uncompleted job and assign the next operation of which together with its successors in no-wait constraint on the corresponding processing machines. A hierarchical PPO-based training algorithm is developed. Extensive numerical experiments have confirmed the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed HMAPPO compared with other well-known dynamic scheduling methods.",

      "summary": "This paper addresses the complex challenge of the dynamic partial-no-wait multiobjective flexible job shop scheduling problem (DMOFJSP-PNW) using a novel hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning approach termed HMAPPO. This framework is particularly pertinent in modern manufacturing environments characterized by dynamic disturbances, where efficiency and effectiveness in scheduling are critical. The authors propose a method using three different agents—objective, job, and machine agents—each operating at distinct control levels. The objective agent assesses the overall objective periodically, while the job and machine agents focus on selecting tasks and allocating resources. Each agent utilizes various heuristics for effective scheduling, emphasizing a comprehensive strategy that integrates multiple scheduling goals, including TWT, average machine utilization, and workload variance. Key contributions include the development of a hierarchical PPO-based training algorithm and the design of specific job selection and machine assignment rules. Performance evaluations through extensive numerical experiments establish the superiority of HMAPPO over conventional dynamic scheduling techniques, demonstrating both effectiveness and efficiency, evidenced by significant improvements in the performance metrics across diverse scenarios. This approach shows considerable promise for application in industries with stringent scheduling needs, such as aerospace and steel manufacturing, thereby contributing to optimized production processes in Industry 4.0 contexts. Future research directions include expanding the model to address additional uncertainties and objectives, aiming for a more holistic approach to production scheduling.",

      "title": "A deep reinforcement learning model for dynamic job-shop scheduling problem with uncertain processing time",
      "abstract": "The dynamic job-shop scheduling problem (DJSP) is a type of scheduling tasks where rescheduling is performed when encountering the uncertainties such as the uncertain operation processing time. However, the current deep reinforcement learning (DRL) scheduling approaches are hard to train convergent scheduling policies as the problem scale increases, which is very important for rescheduling under uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a DRL scheduling method for DJSP based on the proximal policy optimization (PPO) with hybrid prioritized experience replay. The job shop scheduling problem is formulated as a sequential decision-making problem based on Markov Decision Process (MDP) where a novel state representation is designed based on the feasible solution matrix which depicts the scheduling order of a scheduling task, a set of paired priority dispatching rules (PDR) are used as the actions and a new intuitive reward function is established based on the machine idle time. Moreover, a new hybrid prioritized experience replay method for PPO is proposed to reduce the training time where samples with positive temporal-difference (TD) error are replayed. Static experiments on classic benchmark instances show that the make-span obtained by our scheduling agent has been reduced by 1.59% on average than the best known DRL methods. In addition, dynamic experiments demonstrate that the training time of the reused scheduling policy is reduced by 27% compared with the retrained policy when encountering uncertainties such as uncertain operation processing time.",

The job shop scheduling problem is modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with a new state representation and an intuitive reward function based on machine idle time. Our unique contribution includes a novel state representation utilizing a feasible solution matrix and an innovative reward function that indirectly reduces the maximum make-span by optimizing for idle machine time.",
      "objectives": "To develop a deep reinforcement learning method to effectively address the dynamic job-shop scheduling problem (DJSP) that considers uncertainties such as variable processing times, and to enhance the convergence of scheduling policies under increasing problem scales.",
      "summary": "In this study, we address the dynamic job-shop scheduling problem (DJSP), a considerable challenge in operational research due to its NP-hard nature and the complexities introduced by uncertain processing times. This paper introduces a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework based on proximal policy optimization (PPO) enhanced with hybrid prioritized experience replay, specifically tailored to optimize scheduling policies amid uncertainty. Our methodology reformulates the scheduling task as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), employing a new state representation utilizing a feasible solution matrix, which streamlines the training process by requiring less static job and machine information. Furthermore, the reward function is ingeniously derived from the machine idle time, establishing a negative linear correlation with the maximum make-span—thus aligning the scheduling objectives with the learning goals. Through extensive static experiments on benchmark instances, we demonstrate that our approach not only achieves superior make-span reductions (1.59% on average better than leading DRL methods) but also significantly accelerates convergence during dynamic rescheduling scenarios, with a 27% reduction in training time for the reused policy compared to traditional retraining methods. This model's robust performance across varied uncertainties suggests promising applications within smart manufacturing contexts, although future work will focus on scaling our approach to accommodate scheduling problems with diverse operation sizes and complexities.",

      "title": "Design Principles for Industrie 4.0 Scenarios",
      "abstract": "The increasing integration of the Internet of Everything into the industrial value chain has built the foundation for the next industrial revolution called Industrie 4.0. Although Industrie 4.0 is currently a top priority for many companies, research centers, and universities, a generally accepted understanding of the term does not exist. As a result, discussing the topic on an academic level is difficult, and so is implementing Industrie 4.0 scenarios. Based on a quantitative text analysis and a qualitative literature review, the paper identifies design principles of Industrie 4.0. Taking into account these principles, academics may be enabled to further investigate on the topic, while practitioners may find assistance in identifying appropriate scenarios. A case study illustrates how the identified design principles support practitioners in identifying Industrie 4.0 scenarios.",
      "method": "The paper employs a combination of quantitative text analysis and qualitative literature review to identify design principles of Industrie 4.0. The approach includes a systematic review of academic and practical publications to derive four key design principles for implementing Industrie 4.0 scenarios: interconnection, information transparency, decentralized decisions, and technical assistance.",
      "objectives": "This paper aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of Industrie 4.0 by identifying explicit design principles that practitioners can use to develop and implement appropriate solutions. It aims to enable further academic investigation and practical implementation of Industrie 4.0 scenarios.",
      "summary": "The paper addresses the challenge of understanding and implementing Industrie 4.0, the next industrial revolution characterized by the integration of the Internet of Everything into industrial value chains. Despite its prominence, there is no universal definition or understanding of Industrie 4.0, complicating academic discourse and practical implementation. The authors perform a quantitative text analysis and qualitative literature review to derive four design principles crucial for implementing Industrie 4.0: interconnection, information transparency, decentralized decision-making, and technical assistance. The authors conducted an extensive literature review, analyzing 130 academic and practical publications. This process revealed common themes and design elements within existing literature, ultimately leading to the formulation of the four guiding principles.\n\nThe case study provided in the paper exemplifies the application of these principles in a real-world scenario, where a collaboration between a chemical industry company and various academic institutions aimed to identify and develop Industrie 4.0 scenarios. By utilizing a nominal group workshop consisting of practitioners from diverse fields, the project clearly illustrates how these design principles were integrated into identifying and prioritizing potential scenarios. Throughout the collaborative process, participants were guided by the principles, which helped streamline scenario evaluation based on compliance with Industrie 4.0 objectives, contribution to strategic goals, and overall feasibility.\n\nKey findings indicate that the emphasis on such design principles fosters a shared understanding among practitioners, improves strategic alignment with business objectives, and facilitates the identification of actionable scenarios that are ready for implementation. The paper concludes that while the identified principles serve as a foundation for both academic research and practical applications, future work could further explore their adaptability across different industries and operational contexts. Overall, the study contributes significantly to both the academic discourse surrounding Industrie 4.0 and the practical strategies for its implementation, paving the way for evolving manufacturing and production paradigms.",

      "title": "Cluster analysis and neural network-based metamodeling of priority rules for dynamic sequencing",
      "abstract": "Most sequencing problems deal with deterministic environments where all information is known in advance. However, in real-world problems multiple sources of uncertainty need to be taken into consideration. To model such a situation, in this article, a dynamic sequencing problem with random arrivals, processing times and due-dates is considered. The examined system is a manufacturing line with multiple job classes and sequence-dependent setups. The performance of the system is measured under the metrics of mean WIP, mean cycle time, mean earliness, mean tardiness, mean absolute lateness, and mean percentage of tardy jobs. Twelve job dispatching rules for solving this problem are considered and evaluated via simulation experiments. A statistically rigorous analysis of the solution approaches is carried out with the use of unsupervised and supervised learning methods. The cluster analysis of the experimental results identified classes of priority rules based on their observed performance. The characteristics of each priority rule class are documented and areas in objective space not covered by existing rules are identified. The functional relationship between sequencing priority rules and performance metrics of the production system was approximated by artificial neural networks. Apart from gaining insight into the mechanics of the sequencing approaches the results of this article can be used (1) as a component for prediction systems of dispatching rule output, (2) as a guideline for building new dispatching heuristics with entirely different characteristics than existing ones, (3) to significantly decrease the length of what-if simulation studies.",

The paper's significant contributions include identifying under-explored areas of dispatching rules that can lead to new heuristic developments, using artificial neural networks to approximate relationships between decision rules and performance metrics, and establishing a predictive capability for dispatch systems. The methodology included comprehensive statistical analysis and simulation setups that allowed the examination of rule performance across diverse system configurations. This provided insights not only into the characteristics of each rule but also introduced innovative techniques that could be applied to optimize dynamic manufacturing scheduling. The findings are also valuable for practitioners seeking to implement intelligent scheduling solutions in environments with varying demand and resource constraints.",
