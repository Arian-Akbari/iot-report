The no-wait job shop scheduling problem (NWJSP) imposes significant operational constraints where jobs must be processed without any waiting time between operations. This paper tackles the complexity of NWJSP, which is classified as NP-hard, by proposing a novel population-based iterated greedy (PBIG) algorithm, enhancing the iterated greedy framework by integrating co-evolutionary strategies. The main contributions of this research include an extension of the widely recognized Nawaz-Enscore-Ham (NEH) heuristic adapted for NWJSP to ensure high-quality initial solutions and a sophisticated initialization scheme aimed at generating diverse starting points for the algorithm.

The PBIG operates through a structured procedural framework that consists of a three-phase iterated greedy process: first using a destruction and construction approach to create candidate solutions, followed by a localized insertion-based improvement phase, to refine the solutions iteratively. This algorithm exploits population dynamics by processing multiple solutions concurrently, applying co-evolutionary strategies that enhance the algorithmic diversity and convergence speed. Moreover, it combines various timetabling methods, notably the left and inverse left timetabling techniques, which are shown to significantly improve performance metrics.

The computational analysis involved executing the PBIG against established benchmarks and comparing its efficacy against two competing metaheuristics. The results indicate that PBIG not only provides superior schedule quality but also achieves this with greater computational efficiency, substantiating its practicality for industrial applications that face the no-wait constraints typical in sectors like steel-making, pharmaceuticals, and food production. The findings importantly underscore the capabilities of the PBIG framework in engaging with complex scheduling challenges, which promise further insights and advancements in scheduling methodologies in future research.

This paper introduces an enhanced Ant System algorithm aimed at addressing the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) characterized by a single central depot and homogeneous vehicles. The methodology emphasizes the interaction of artificial ants which emulate behaviors observed in natural ant colonies during their search for food. The improved algorithm takes advantage of local heuristic functions and adaptive memory (akin to pheromone trails), facilitating the construction of competitive solutions. The authors applied their algorithm to fourteen benchmark problems, focusing on both randomly generated and clustered customer distributions. The comparative evaluation included five other established metaheuristics, such as tabu search and simulated annealing.

Key contributions include meticulous description of the construction of vehicle routes, which involves probabilistic customer selection based on previous iterations and heuristic desirability. The model incorporates a trail update rule where updates are contingent on the quality of solutions produced by the best-ranked ants, thus refining the pheromone trails that guide future solutions. The computational results demonstrate the algorithm's competitiveness, although it could not improve upon the best-known solutions for the tested problems. Comparative results indicated that while tabu search methods yielded better solutions in general, the improved Ant System provided a valid alternative with notable improvements in solution quality and execution time.

Future research directions proposed include the exploration of different parameter settings, incorporation of VRP-specific local search methods, and potential parallel implementation of the algorithm. The findings substantiate the efficacy of the improved Ant System, suggesting promising avenues for further advancements in solving the VRP and related combinatorial optimization problems.

The paper presents a novel hybrid algorithm that integrates Differential Evolution (DE) and Tabu Search (TS) to address the Job-Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP), which is known for its computational complexity and has significant industrial applications. The primary motivation for this research stems from the unique combinatorial nature of JSSP, which often renders traditional optimization methods ineffective, particularly for larger instances. The authors devised a hybrid DE-TS algorithm that combines the global exploration strength of Differential Evolution with the local search capability of Tabu Search, creating a solution framework that not only seeks to optimize job scheduling sequences but also mitigates the common issues related to premature convergence associated with standard evolutionary algorithms.

In breaking down the method, the authors first elaborate on Differential Evolution's adaptation to permutation-based problems, utilizing a Random Keys encoding scheme to represent job sequences. The proposed algorithm operates by allowing DE to explore the search space and identify promising regions before invoking TS to perform local searches for the best schedules within those regions. A competitive neighborhood structure is implemented in TS to enhance the efficiency of local searches, particularly focusing on critical operation swaps, which have a direct impact on the overall makespan of schedules.

Through extensive computational experiments involving over 100 benchmark instances sourced from established problem libraries, the hybrid DE-TS algorithm demonstrated competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art scheduling algorithms including variants of Tabu Search. While the results showcased the algorithm's ability to achieve optimal solutions in many mid-sized instances, it also highlighted areas for potential improvement, specifically concerning the representation compatibility between DE and TS, and the need for more sophisticated initialization techniques to further augment performance.

The significance of the findings extends beyond mere algorithmic accomplishments; they contribute to the underlying discourse surrounding algorithm hybridization in solving NP-hard problems like JSSP. Moreover, this research paves the way for future exploration into more advanced hybrid methodologies, suggesting potential avenues like the integration of self-adaptive mechanisms in DE and improved constraint handling techniques that can enhance the robustness and adaptability of the proposed solutions for JSSP and similar combinatorial challenges to come.

The paper explores the application of Differential Evolution (DE) to solving Jobshop Scheduling Problems (JSP), a classic challenge in operational research that involves allocating machines to jobs in such a way that minimizes the completion time, or makespan. The primary difficulty lies in the effective representation of permutations of jobs using real numbers, which is addressed by developing new encoding methods within DE. The authors empirically validate various strategies on well-established problem instances. They identify three key permutation representation modes: random keys, dispatching rules, and binary priorities, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, and test these variants under different scheduling frameworks.

In their experiments, the DE algorithm is tuned with parameters such as mutation factor and crossover rate, set within specific bounds based on preliminary analyses. Results demonstrate that the random keys method yields the most promising outcomes in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency across various instances of the JSP. The study also includes a hybrid approach combining DE with tabu search (TS) which enhances the solution quality further, especially in more complex scenarios.

Computational experiments reveal that while DE alone cannot compete with state-of-the-art algorithms like i-TSAB, its performance improves greatly when hybridized with local search techniques. The DE-TS hybrid showed competitive results, although the performance of DE alone improves more gradually, suggesting that the traditional modes of optimization may still dominate in effectively tackling the JSP. The key contributions of this work include advancements in representation schemes for DE applied to permutation problems and a foundation for further hybrid methodologies, potentially driving future research directions in this domain. Overall, the findings highlight DE's effectiveness when suitably adapted for structured scheduling environments, indicating room for improvement in algorithm development and integration of different optimization strategies.

This study tackles the dynamic job shop scheduling problem (JSSP), a known NP-Hard optimization task characterized by the unpredictable arrival of new jobs, machine breakdowns, and task cancellations in realtime manufacturing environments. These disruptions necessitate effective re-scheduling strategies to maintain optimal utilization of system resources and to minimize makespan, which is defined as the completion time of the last job.

The study includes detailed testing of this GA against state-of-the-art heuristics and metaheuristics, analyzing performance metrics including makespan and computational efficiency. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method significantly improves performance, achieving better makespan values across various instances of dynamic JSSP compared to existing approaches. Its significance lies in providing a robust framework for scheduling in unpredictable manufacturing environments, thus presenting valuable insights for real-world applications where adaptability is essential. Future implications include further exploration of enhancing crossover strategies and integrating additional scheduling constraints to refine the algorithm's applicability in even more complex dynamic scenarios.
