This paper addresses the pressing issue of energy consumption in manufacturing, especially within the context of Industry 4.0. The primary problem tackled is how to integrate sustainability into manufacturing processes, given the growing concerns about climate change and resource depletion. The authors introduce a smart mathematical model designed to improve job shop scheduling from an energy-saving perspective, demonstrating the feasibility of incorporating this model into a current Manufacturing Execution System (MES) in a real-world industrial setting. 

The study begins by discussing the theoretical foundation of sustainability and the principles of Industry 4.0, arguing for their interconnectedness. The mathematical model proposed is implemented in a medium-sized enterprise involved in aircraft component production, where it aims to reduce energy expenditure during manufacturing operations. The model utilizes an on/off strategy to manage machine idle times, thus minimizing energy consumption, which is particularly impactful considering that a significant portion of the energy operational costs arise during idle periods.

Key findings indicate that applying the proposed job scheduling approach can enhance energy efficiency significantly. In the case study presented, a reduction in operational costs was noted, achieving a savings of 1.2% compared to conventional scheduling methods. Importantly, the results suggest that such scheduling not only benefits economic efficiency but also contributes positively to environmental sustainability by reducing energy wastage and associated CO2 emissions.

In conclusion, the paper suggests that future research could focus on refining the scheduling model to include additional parameters, such as machine setup times and energy generated from renewable sources, thereby enhancing the model's applicability in increasingly eco-conscious industrial environments. This work demonstrates a practical intersection between advanced manufacturing technologies and sustainability, illustrating how the implementation of smart scheduling models can lead industries toward a more sustainable future while maintaining competitive edges in productivity and cost-efficiency.

This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the research developments surrounding the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP) in the context of Industry 5.0, emphasizing the integration of human factors and environmental considerations. The emergence of Industry 4.0 has already instigated significant changes in the methodologies used for scheduling problems within manufacturing systems. As we transition towards Industry 5.0, the focus shifts onto three core values: human-centricity, sustainability, and resilience. The research highlights that human operators significantly influence scheduling performance through factors such as skills and well-being, while production scheduling must now also account for the facilitiesâ€™ environmental impact, particularly energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. The proposed Sustainable Flexible Scheduling Problem (SFJSSP) encapsulates these issues, representing a shift towards more socially responsible and environmentally friendly scheduling practices. Through an analysis of the last decade's literature, the paper identifies existing gaps in research, particularly the lack of a dynamic perspective incorporating both human and environmental factors simultaneously. Notably, the findings suggest the need for future studies to marry these elements into scheduling models, utilizing advanced computational techniques such as hybrid algorithms that combine heuristic and AI approaches for more effective scheduling outcomes. The significance of future research is underscored by the need to address the complexities posed by dynamic scheduling environments and the specific challenges arising from the reintegration of human-centered design principles in manufacturing systems.

Dynamic job-shop scheduling is essential for optimizing production processes but often faces challenges due to machine unavailability and various disturbances. The paper addresses these issues by incorporating the concept of a digital twin (DT), which creates a sophisticated link between physical machines and their virtual counterparts. The essential contributions of this research include a detailed exploration of DT-based methods for machine availability prediction, disturbance detection, and performance evaluation. The study defines a five-dimension digital twin model for machines, fusing real-time operational data with simulated information to inform scheduling decisions effectively. The predictive capabilities of the DT enable early detection of machine faults and tool wear, predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of tools while ensuring machines are available when required. Moreover, disturbances are detected by comparing parameters of the physical machine with those of its digital counterpart, allowing for timely adjustments to live scheduling conditions.

A case study involving a machining job-shop producing hydraulic valves demonstrates the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed methodologies. The results show substantial improvements in scheduling performance metrics, such as reduced makespan, minimized tardiness, and enhanced machine utilization. Furthermore, the DT model's multi-dimensional capabilities provide comprehensive insights into operational efficiency, including energy consumption and stress levels of machinery, thereby elevating the overall production system's responsiveness and reliability. The paper concludes that the DT-enhanced dynamic scheduling methodology not only addresses the current limitations in job-shop scheduling but also sets the groundwork for further expansions in smart manufacturing practices, emphasizing an integrated approach that could yield significant flexibility and efficiency in future industrial operations.
