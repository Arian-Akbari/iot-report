Survey of integrated flexible job shop scheduling problems,"The flexible job shop scheduling problems (FJSP) has been studied for many years, and many different mathematical models and solution approaches have been developed. With the proposal and implementation of Industry 4.0, more focus has been on the integrated optimization of the FJSP to enhance its practicality. However, few reviews on the integrated optimization of the FJSP have been reported. To grasp the current development trend of the integrated FJSP (I-FJSP), this paper presents a comprehensive literature review of the I-FJSP and its extensions. In this context, 140 related articles were collected and analyzed. First, the mathematical model of the FJSP and the overview framework are presented.

No-Wait Job Shop Scheduling Using a Population-Based Iterated Greedy Algorithm,"When no-wait constraint holds in job shops, a job has to be processed with no waiting time from the first to the last operation, and the start time of a job is greatly restricted. Using key elements of the iterated greedy algorithm, this paper proposes a population-based iterated greedy (PBIG) algorithm for finding high-quality schedules in no-wait job shops. Firstly, the Nawaz-Enscore-Ham (NEH) heuristic used for flow shop is extended in no-wait job shops, and an initialization scheme based on the NEH heuristic is developed to generate start solutions with a certain quality and diversity. Secondly, the iterated greedy procedure is introduced based on the destruction and construction perturbator and the insert-based local search. Furthermore, a population-based co-evolutionary scheme is presented by imposing the iterated greedy procedure in parallel and hybridizing both the left timetabling and inverse left timetabling methods. Computational results based on well-known benchmark instances show that the proposed algorithm outperforms two existing metaheuristics by a significant margin.","Population-based iterated greedy (PBIG) algorithm utilizing a co-evolutionary scheme, incorporating a destruction and construction perturbator and an insertion-based local search, as well as the Nawaz-Enscore-Ham (NEH) heuristic for initialization.",To develop an effective algorithm for solving the no-wait job shop scheduling problem (NWJSP) and to demonstrate its effectiveness through computational experiments comparing with existing metaheuristics.,"['no-wait', 'job shop', 'local search', 'iterated greedy', 'metaheuristics']","The no-wait job shop scheduling problem (NWJSP) imposes significant operational constraints where jobs must be processed without any waiting time between operations. This paper tackles the complexity of NWJSP, which is classified as NP-hard, by proposing a novel population-based iterated greedy (PBIG) algorithm, enhancing the iterated greedy framework by integrating co-evolutionary strategies. The main contributions of this research include an extension of the widely recognized Nawaz-Enscore-Ham (NEH) heuristic adapted for NWJSP to ensure high-quality initial solutions and a sophisticated initialization scheme aimed at generating diverse starting points for the algorithm.

The PBIG operates through a structured procedural framework that consists of a three-phase iterated greedy process: first using a destruction and construction approach to create candidate solutions, followed by a localized insertion-based improvement phase, to refine the solutions iteratively. This algorithm exploits population dynamics by processing multiple solutions concurrently, applying co-evolutionary strategies that enhance the algorithmic diversity and convergence speed. Moreover, it combines various timetabling methods, notably the left and inverse left timetabling techniques, which are shown to significantly improve performance metrics.

The computational analysis involved executing the PBIG against established benchmarks and comparing its efficacy against two competing metaheuristics. The results indicate that PBIG not only provides superior schedule quality but also achieves this with greater computational efficiency, substantiating its practicality for industrial applications that face the no-wait constraints typical in sectors like steel-making, pharmaceuticals, and food production. The findings importantly underscore the capabilities of the PBIG framework in engaging with complex scheduling challenges, which promise further insights and advancements in scheduling methodologies in future research.",undefined series for scimag 5 - Annaâ€™s Archive.pdf,2025-08-20 01:39:59

An Effective Hybrid Imperialist Competitive Algorithm and Tabu Search for an Extended Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem,"An extended version of the flexible job shop problem is tackled in this work. The investigated extension of the classical flexible job shop problem allows the precedences between the operations to be given by an arbitrary directed acyclic graph instead of a linear order.

The Shifting Bottleneck Procedure for Job Shop Scheduling,"We describe an approximation method for solving the minimum makespan problem of job shop scheduling. It sequences the machines one by one, successively, taking each time the machine identified as a bottleneck among the machines not yet sequenced. Every time after a new machine is sequenced, all previously established sequences are locally reoptimized. Both the bottleneck identification and the local reoptimization procedures are based on repeatedly solving certain one-machine scheduling problems. Besides this straight version of the Shifting Bottleneck Procedure, we have also implemented a version that applies the procedure to the nodes of a partial search tree. Computational testing shows that our approach yields consistently better results than other procedures discussed in the literature. A high point of our computational testing occurred when the enumerative version of the Shifting Bottleneck Procedure found in a little over five minutes an optimal schedule to a notorious ten machines/ten jobs problem on which many algorithms have been run for hours without finding an optimal solution.","We sequence the machines one at a time, consecutively. In order to do this, for each machine not yet sequenced we solve to optimality a one-machine scheduling problem that is a relaxation of the original problem, and use the outcome both to rank the machines and to sequence the machine with highest rank. Every time a new machine has been sequenced, we reoptimize the sequence of each critical machine that is susceptible to improvement by again solving a one-machine problem.","To provide an effective approximation method for solving the minimum makespan problem in job shop scheduling, improving upon existing scheduling methods.","['PRODUCTION SCHEDULING', 'JOB SHOP', 'DETERMINISTIC']","The paper addresses the challenging problem of job shop scheduling, specifically focusing on minimizing the makespan, which is the total time required to complete a set of jobs on machines with prescribed sequences. Job shop scheduling is a well-known NP-complete problem, making exact solutions infeasible for larger instances. The authors propose the Shifting Bottleneck Procedure, which sequences machines iteratively, where in each iteration a bottleneck machine is identified and sequenced optimally followed by local reoptimization of the sequences of previously sequenced machines. The method relies on solving simpler one-machine scheduling problems to determine the order of machines based on their impact on the overall makespan. A key innovation of this approach is its ability to continuously reoptimize schedules, which often leads to improved outcomes compared to traditional priority-based heuristics.

In computational experiments, the authors demonstrated the effectiveness of their method, notably achieving optimal schedules for notoriously complex problems involving ten jobs and ten machines within minutes â€“ a task that other algorithms have struggled with for much longer durations without success. The methodology uses a directed acyclic graph representation for scheduling and implements an O(n) algorithm for finding the longest path, which is crucial for determining critical paths in the scheduling process.
